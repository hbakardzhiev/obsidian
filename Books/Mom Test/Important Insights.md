### What you should do in an interview according to the `The Mom Test`?
1) Talk about their life instead of your idea
2) Ask about specifics in the past instead of generics or opinions about the future
3) Talk less and listen more
You should ask questions `that even your mom can’t lie to you about`.


### Bad questions
- Do you think it's a good idea? 
	- Let’s fix it: Say you’re building an app to help construction companies manage their suppliers. You might ask them to show you how they currently do it. Talk about which parts they love and hate. Ask which other tools and processes they tried before settling on this one. Are they actively searching for a replacement? If so, what’s the sticking point? If not, why not? Where are they losing money with their current tools? Is there a budget for better ones? Now, take all that information and decide for yourself whether it’s a good idea.
	- Rule of  thumb: **Opinions are worthless.**
- Would you buy a product which did X?
	- Let’s fix it: Ask how they currently solve X and how much it costs them to do so. And how much time it takes. Ask them to talk you through what happened the last time X came up. If they haven’t solved the problem, ask why not. Have they tried searching for solutions and found them wanting? Or do they not even care enough to have Googled for it?
	- Rule of  thumb: **Anything involving the future is an over-optimistic lie.**
- How much would you pay for X?
	- How to fix it: Just like the others, fix it by asking about their life as it already is. How much does the problem cost them? How much do they currently pay to solve it? How big is the budget they’ve allocated? I hope you’re noticing a trend here.
	- Rule of  thumb: **People will lie to you if they think it’s what you want to hear**

### Sort-of-okay questions
- What would your dream product do?
	- Let’s improve it: The value comes from understanding why they want these features. You don’t want to just collect feature requests. You aren’t building the product by committee. But the motivations and constraints behind those requests are critical. 
	- It sets the tone for exploration by asking more questions down the road.
	- Rule of  thumb: People **know what their problems are, but they don’t know how to solve them**.

### Good questions
- Why do you bother?
	- The “why do you bother” question led to “so we can be certain that we’re all working off the latest version.” Aha. The solution ended up being less like the requested messaging tool and more like Dropbox. A question like “why do you bother” points toward their motivations. It gives you the why. 
	- Rule of  thumb: **You're shooting blind until you understand their goals.**
- What are the implications of that?
	- I once had someone keep describing the workflow we were fixing with emotionally loaded terms like “DISASTER”, accompanied by much yelling and arm waving. But when I asked him what the implications were, he sort of shrugged and said “Oh, we just ended up throwing a bunch of interns at the problem—it’s actually working pretty well.”
		- So someone can try to blow out a problem out of proportion but asking them `What are the implications?` can reveal that maybe that is not really a big problem.
	- Rule of  thumb: **Some problems don’t (actually) matter.**
- Talk me through the last time that happened.
	- “show, not tell” -> whenever possible, you want to be shown, not told by your customers
	- Get as close to the real action as you can. Seeing it first hand can provide unique insight into murky situations. But if you can’t get in there, asking them to talk you through the last time it happened still offers many of the benefits. 
	- Rule of  thumb: Watching someone do a task will **show you where the problems and inefficiencies really are, not where the customer thinks they are**.
- What else have you tried?
	- What are they using now?
	- How much does it cost and what do they love and hate about it? 
	- How much would those fixes be worth and how big of a pain would it be for them to switch to a new solution?
	- When’s the last time this came up?
	- Did you google around for any other ways to solve it?
	- Rule of  thumb: **If they haven't looked for ways of solving it already, they're not going to look for (or buy) yours.**
- Would you pay X for a product which did Y?
	- Let’s fix it: As always, ask about what they currently do now, not what they believe they might do in the future. Common wisdom is that you price your product in terms of value to the customer rather than cost to you. That's true. And you can't quantify the value received without prodding their financial worldview.
	- *literally ask for money*:
		- If you have the deposit or pre-order in hand, you know they were telling the truth.
- How are you dealing with it now?
	- Beyond workflow information, this gives you a price anchor. If they’re paying £100/month for a duct-tape workaround, you know which ballpark you're playing in. On the other hand, they may have spent £120,000 this year on agency fees to maintain a site you're replacing. If that's the case, you don't want to be having the £100 conversation.
	- Rule of  thumb: While it’s rare for someone to tell you precisely what they’ll pay you, **they’ll often show you what it’s worth to them**.
- Where does the money come from?
	- Leads to a conversation about whose budget the purchase will come from and who else within their company holds the power to torpedo the deal. 
	- Often, **you'll find yourself talking to someone other than the budget owner**.
- Is there anything else I should have asked?
	- Asking this question gives the people being interviewed a chance to politely “fix” your line of questioning. And they will!
	- This question is a bit of a crutch: you’ll discard it as you get better at asking good questions and as you get to know the industry.
	- Rule of  thumb: **People want to help you, but they rarely do so unless you give them an excuse to do so**.


# Avoiding Bad Data
### Things to watch out for
1) Compliments
2) Fluff (generics, hypotheticals, and the future)
3) Ideas

### What to do in conversation with compliments
- Always ignore compliments and ask them to walk you through the current workflow that they have
- Question such as:
	- Can you talk me through how it actually all fits together?
	- What sort of difficulties have come up with that solution?

### Difference between data and compliment
- Why did that person like the idea? 
- How much money would it save him?
- How would it fit into his life? 
- What else has he tried which failed to solve his problem? 
Not being able to answer these questions means that you’ve got a compliment instead of real data.

### What question to not ask since they bias the interviewee?
- “Do you ever…”
- “Would you ever…”
- “What do you usually…”
- “Do you think you…”
- “Might you…”
- “Could you see yourself…”

- **Instead ask about the past and how are they solving it now?**
