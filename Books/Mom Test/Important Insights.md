### What you should do in an interview according to the `The Mom Test`?
1) Talk about their life instead of your idea
2) Ask about specifics in the past instead of generics or opinions about the future
3) Talk less and listen more
You should ask questions `that even your mom can’t lie to you about`.


### Bad questions
- Do you think it's a good idea? 
	- Let’s fix it: Say you’re building an app to help construction companies manage their suppliers. You might ask them to show you how they currently do it. Talk about which parts they love and hate. Ask which other tools and processes they tried before settling on this one. Are they actively searching for a replacement? If so, what’s the sticking point? If not, why not? Where are they losing money with their current tools? Is there a budget for better ones? Now, take all that information and decide for yourself whether it’s a good idea.
- Would you buy a product which did X?
	- Let’s fix it: Ask how they currently solve X and how much it costs them to do so. And how much time it takes. Ask them to talk you through what happened the last time X came up. If they haven’t solved the problem, ask why not. Have they tried searching for solutions and found them wanting? Or do they not even care enough to have Googled for it?
- How much would you pay for X?
	- How to fix it: Just like the others, fix it by asking about their life as it already is. How much does the problem cost them? How much do they currently pay to solve it? How big is the budget they’ve allocated? I hope you’re noticing a trend here.

### Sort-of-okay questions
- What would your dream product do?
	- Let’s improve it: The value comes from understanding why they want these features. You don’t want to just collect feature requests. You aren’t building the product by committee. But the motivations and constraints behind those requests are critical. 
	- It sets the tone for exploration by asking more questions down the road.

### Good questions
- Why do you bother?
	- The “why do you bother” question led to “so we can be certain that we’re all working off the latest version.” Aha. The solution ended up being less like the requested messaging tool and more like Dropbox. A question like “why do you bother” points toward their motivations. It gives you the why. 
- What are the implications of that?
	- I once had someone keep describing the workflow we were fixing with emotionally loaded terms like “DISASTER”, accompanied by much yelling and arm waving. But when I asked him what the implications were, he sort of shrugged and said “Oh, we just ended up throwing a bunch of interns at the problem—it’s actually working pretty well.”
		- So someone can try to blow out a problem out of proportion but asking them [[Important Insights.md#Good question]] can reveal that maybe that is not really a big problem.
