### What you should do in an interview according to the `The Mom Test`?
1) Talk about their life instead of your idea
2) Ask about specifics in the past instead of generics or opinions about the future
3) Talk less and listen more
You should ask questions `that even your mom can’t lie to you about`.


### Bad questions
- Do you think it's a good idea? 
	-> Let’s fix it: Say you’re building an app to help construction companies manage their suppliers. You might ask them to show you how they currently do it. Talk about which parts they love and hate. Ask which other tools and processes they tried before settling on this one. Are they actively searching for a replacement? If so, what’s the sticking point? If not, why not? Where are they losing money with their current tools? Is there a budget for better ones? Now, take all that information and decide for yourself whether it’s a good idea.

- Would you buy a product which did X?
	-> Let’s fix it: Ask how they currently solve X and how much it costs them to do so. And how much time it takes. Ask them to talk you through what happened the last time X came up. If they haven’t solved the problem, ask why not. Have they 
tried searching for solutions and found them wanting? Or do they not even care 
enough to have Googled for it?
