### What you should do in an interview according to the `The Mom Test`?
1) Talk about their life instead of your idea
2) Ask about specifics in the past instead of generics or opinions about the future
3) Talk less and listen more
You should ask questions `that even your mom canâ€™t lie to you about`.
