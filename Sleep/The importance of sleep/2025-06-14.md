Woke up today in NL at 5am, not because of an alarm but purely because it was too hot. I am generally a good sleeper but today has proved that you can feel extremely ill if you don't sleep enough.
Yesterday the temperature in the Netherlands reached 31 and even late in the night 11pm the temperature was still over 24. 
I am becoming a big believer in what "@levelsio" (X account) has been [claiming](https://x.com/levelsio/status/1804515556269129729) about needing 18 degrees to sleep. When I buy a house, getting an airconditioner so that I can sleep at 18 degrees will be mandatory.
