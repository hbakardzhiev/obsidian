Woke up today in the Netherlands at 5am, not because of an alarm but purely because it was too hot. I am generally a good sleeper but today has proved that you can feel extremely ill if you don't sleep enough.
Yesterday the temperature in the Netherlands reached 31 and even late in the night 11pm the temperature was still over 24. 
I am becoming a big believer in what "@levelsio" (X account) has been [claiming](https://x.com/levelsio/status/1804515556269129729) about needing 18 degrees to sleep. When I buy a house, getting an airconditioner so that I can sleep at 18 degrees will be mandatory. 
He created a [post](https://x.com/levelsio/status/1916463913681461480) how he gets very high quality sleep. I will paste here what I want to implement in my life:
> 1) very cold bedroom 18-20°C / 64-68°F (colder better)
> 2) mostly clean diet of meat + vegetables + fruit + black coffee + sparkling water with lemon (and sometimes cheat with dark choco), not a lot of carbs (almost never pasta or regular potatoes for ex but sometimes rice or sweet potatoes)

He seems to be a high functioning individual owning many business whilst training like a maniac. Perhaps this is the formula for a good life.
