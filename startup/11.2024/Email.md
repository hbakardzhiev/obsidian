Dear [Teacher's Name], 

I hope you’re doing well! 

I’m reaching out to share an exciting start-up we’re working on and explore how it might align with your plans for the upcoming semester. Together with two fellow graduates, combining expertise in software engineering, venture capital, and sales, we are building UBIridge (University Business Intermediary Bridge) — a platform designed to connect universities and companies, fostering collaboration on real-world projects.  

Our goal is to simplify and enhance the way academia and industry work together, creating more impactful opportunities for students and businesses alike.  

With that in mind, I was curious if you’re facilitating any projects in Semester 2 that could benefit from connections with companies. If so, we’d love the opportunity to help you find suitable organizations through our platform and support the collaboration process. This entire facilitation and help is **completely for free!**

If you’re currently not engaged with that, would you be able to point us toward someone who oversees or facilitates these types of projects? Any guidance or connections would be incredibly valuable as we continue to shape UBIridge into a platform that meets the needs of educators, students and various industries. 

Thank you so much for considering this! I’d be thrilled to hear your thoughts and see how we can collaborate on something meaningful. 

Warm regards, 
UBIridge
