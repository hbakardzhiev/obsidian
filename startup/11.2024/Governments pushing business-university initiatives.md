- Recommendations: Among its recommendations, the review suggested:
    - Reducing the complexity of the UK's innovation support system to make it more accessible, particularly for SMEs.
    - Encouraging academic researchers to engage with industry, viewing time spent in industry as a 'mark of esteem' in career progression.
    - Maintaining or increasing the weighting of 'impact' in the Research Excellence Framework (REF) to promote academic-industry interaction.
    - Improving the role of Technology Transfer Offices (TTOs) in facilitating long-term knowledge exchange rather than short-term revenue generation.
