The article from Unreal Engine's website highlights how Breda University of Applied Sciences (BUas) in the Netherlands is pioneering an innovative approach to game development education. Here's a summary:

- No Traditional Tests: BUas has moved away from traditional examinations. Instead, the focus is on practical, project-based assessments where students work on real game development projects. This approach mirrors the actual game industry's working environment.
- Industry Simulation: The university simulates a professional game development studio environment. Students work in teams, taking on various roles like developers, designers, artists, and producers, which prepares them for real-world job roles.
- Year-long Projects: First-year students start with smaller projects, but by their second and third years, they're involved in more complex, year-long game development projects. These projects often involve collaboration with other disciplines, external companies, or international teams, providing a global perspective and networking opportunities
- Portfolio Development: Students graduate with a substantial portfolio of work. This portfolio is crucial in the game industry, where proof of practical skills can be more valuable than grades or degrees
- Mentorship and Feedback: Instead of tests, students receive continuous feedback from peers, mentors, and industry professionals. This feedback loop helps in refining their skills and understanding industry expectations
- Technology and Tools: BUas ensures students have access to the latest game development technologies, including Unreal Engine, which is used extensively in their curriculum. This hands-on experience with industry-standard tools gives students a competitive edge
- Career Preparation: The curriculum is designed with employability in mind. There are no traditional job placements, but the projects often lead to internships or job offers because companies see the practical experience students gain
- Global Recognition: The program at BUas has gained international acclaim for its approach, leading to partnerships with game companies around the world and attracting students globally
- Inclusivity and Creativity: By removing the pressure of exams, BUas encourages creativity and innovation, allowing students to focus on learning by doing and exploring their creative limits without the fear of failure in a test environment.
