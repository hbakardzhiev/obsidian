- Project management should be as close to the code as possible
- It is preferable if one account rules:
	- communication software
	- project management
	- data management store
	- code repository
- If one account cannot rule all:
	- Then it should rule the communication
	- project management 
	- code repository
	- data management could always become part of the code repository
