Advice:

- validate constantly never give up
- if you believe in the idea don't give up
- keep going (because you are regret if you stop)
- if you don't stay hungry you will fail
- you have to hire slow but fire very fast (no matter the consequences)
- introduce your idea to people, they are your only way towards success
