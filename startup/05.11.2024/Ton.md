- manage 
academic institute - practioniers
- research

professors need research 

- professors connection to business they try to get 3rd stream of money? (grant money!!, they get the IP and also the validation of the academic institute (makes the product more intristcting to sell))



- Makes sense, but professors are understading that students need practical experience.
- Advantageous (easy access but co-create courses)
- Business (academic accreditation, product and services and talent)
- Students easy,(like practical and internships)


Linking pin (eagerness) professors don't like to spend time to teach, but always them to reach out. 
Business don't know the people there, students  don't have internships.

The faculty gets budget if they invite external speakers.

Fieldtrip to ortec finance to see how we can bring the academic world to the business life.

Show the solution to as many as you can.Talk to people
Who has an opinion? Koen write me an email using uni email

Course coordinator final say.

Tutors can only interpret but professors write the course manual
Start with academics because business will want to connect

Potential money for research, data, information, Have to make sure that professors really need it?

Faculty level? 

Start small with deparment then -> Faculty -> uni level


Courses really need practifications (students )

Conviction side of the pitch should be very strong (3 pitches)
course coordinatiors and we will pitch it to them!

students could be the advocates inside of the organization or even the initiators 

Think about how much traction you should generate in the easiest way
