| Do you think your organization/business would benefit from a platform which connects you to international universities, giving you the opportunity to collaborate on projects? | My assumption is the same, however, the question here was asked quite yo imply that a platform is a potential solution. I don't think that there is a another solution just pointing out that if client left to speculate might come up with something different than a platform (I don't personally know what else though) | Medium       | I kind of do, but would like to ask at least 2 people what they imagine as a solution                     | no                                                                            |
