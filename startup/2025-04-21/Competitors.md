They have a web system that starts by asking the professor what they need for the students. The professor can choose the requirements such as the time involvement and everything else. Then the professors uploads the required collaboration.<br>The business can also upload the collaboration that they need, once that is done they are automatically matched with the closest matching already uploaded project. This automatching makes the entire interaction very fast. Once the business applies for the collaboration the professor gets a notification and with their approval the collaboration can start.<br>The benefits of this platform is that this is totally automated.<br>- All communication happens through it<br>- Has user account for management of access<br>- Has feedback and tracking system to evaluate the success of the partnership | ![How it works](https://youtu.be/fvAmCHzyGXo?t=2183)  <br> | Overall, this is extremely close to what |
