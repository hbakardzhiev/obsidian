Businesses can also submit their collaboration needs, and an automated matching system quickly pairs them with the closest matching project. Professors receive notifications when businesses apply, and upon approval, the collaboration begins.<br><br>Key benefits include full automation:<br><br>- All communication occurs within the platform.<br>- User accounts manage access.<br>- Feedback and tracking systems evaluate partnership success. | ![How it works](https://youtu.be/fvAmCHzyGXo?t=2183)  <br> | They consistently manage ~3,500 active projects and collaborate with ~40,000 SMEs.             | Their approach mirrors ours but is far superior. We can’t compete in this niche long-term. Once they expand to Europe, our business is at risk without significant changes. |
