- According to `Opportunity, growth and partnership: a blueprint for change from the UK's universities`, governments should `should create stable and effective incentives for universities to work with each other and with business and the public sector to meet skills needs`.
	- There are already quite some university-business interactions:
		- `600k+ interactions between universities, businesses and partners since 2019`
- Universities can drive growth and enable economic growth through stimulating partnerships with business according to Rain Newton-Smith, Chief Executive of the CBI and Louise Hellem, Chief Economist of the CBI.

- Universities provide a support for businesses but the relationship is not linear. 
	- universities act as a pull attracting talented people and high-growth companies co-locate. This produces an unplanned but symbiotic relationship where academics benefit from industry insights and challenges and universities benefit by talent and collaborate with research teams in deep partnerships.
