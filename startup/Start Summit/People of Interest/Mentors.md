	- Started as a professional skier, began coding during University and became an entrepreneur, then a trauma surgeon and now I’m the CEO and co-founder of Atenia AI. Maybe a little bit unconventional.
	- During University, I co-founded a construction startup with friends, growing it from a simple idea to six-figure revenue within a year— and went on to double growth annually for the next 2 years
