## Introduction
### Moscow and Saint Petersburg are definitely worth visiting.
----
Literally the best looking city in Europe is called **Moscow**. How is that possible? I have no idea.

- Initially my thoughts were that Russia has:
	- outdoor toilets
	- poor people
	- lack of western products and empty shelfs in general
#### However:
- I was nothing short of amazed.
	- The society seemed very capitalistic (complete opposite of the belief that they like socialism).
	- It really felt that the society had so much money. Everyone seemed to be throwing money everywhere at anything. These weren't tourists, but actual Russian people.
	- There I have seen far more products from Western Europe than I see in Western Europe itself (of course, they are more expensive). I know that some wouldn't believe but this is the honest truth.
	- These towns (Saint Petersburg and Moscow) are really gigantic. 

## Russian pride
#### This is a chapter on its own
- I have no way to express how proud are Russians of their heritage. They have created countless number of monuments that are used to signify every important event from their history. For example:
	- The siege of Leningrad (Saint Petersburg)
	- The first world war
	- The fall of the Romanov family (royal family)
	- Communist monuments
	- and many many others
