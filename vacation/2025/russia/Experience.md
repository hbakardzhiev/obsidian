### Moscow and Saint Petersburg were very interesting.
----
Literally the best looking city in Europe is called Moscow. How is that possible? I have no idea.

- Initially my thoughts were that:
	- outdoor toilets
	- poor people
	- lack of western products and products in general

#### However:
- I was nothing short of amazed.
	- The society seemed very capitalistic (complete opposite of the belief that they like socialism)
	- It really felt that the society had so much money. Everyone seemed to be throwing money everywhere at anything. These weren't tourists, but actual Russian people.
