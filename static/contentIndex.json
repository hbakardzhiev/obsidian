You might ask them to show you how they currently do it. Talk about which parts they love and hate. Ask which other tools and processes they tried before settling on this one. Are they actively searching for a replacement? If so, what’s the sticking point? If not, why not? Where are they losing money with their current tools? Is there a budget for better ones? Now, take all that information and decide for yourself whether it’s a good idea.\nRule of  thumb: Opinions are worthless.\n\n\nWould you buy a product which did X?\n\nLet’s fix it: Ask how they currently solve X and how much it costs them to do so. And how much time it takes. Ask them to talk you through what happened the last time X came up. If they haven’t solved the problem, ask why not. Have they tried searching for solutions and found them wanting? Or do they not even care enough to have Googled for it?\nRule of  thumb: Anything involving the future is an over-optimistic lie.\n\n\nHow much would you pay for X?\n\nHow to fix it: Just like the others, fix it by asking about their life as it already is. How much does the problem cost them? How much do they currently pay to solve it? How big is the budget they’ve allocated? I hope you’re noticing a trend here.\nRule of  thumb: People will lie to you if they think it’s what you want to hear\n\n\n\nSort-of-okay questions\n\nWhat would your dream product do?\n\nLet’s improve it: The value comes from understanding why they want these features. You don’t want to just collect feature requests. You aren’t building the product by committee. But the motivations and constraints behind those requests are critical.\nIt sets the tone for exploration by asking more questions down the road.\nRule of  thumb: People know what their problems are, but they don’t know how to solve them.\n\n\n\nGood questions\n\nWhy do you bother?\n\nThe “why do you bother” question led to “so we can be certain that we’re all working off the latest version.” Aha. The solution ended up being less like the requested messaging tool and more like Dropbox. A question like “why do you bother” points toward their motivations. It gives you the why.\nRule of  thumb: You’re shooting blind until you understand their goals.\n\n\nWhat are the implications of that?\n\nI once had someone keep describing the workflow we were fixing with emotionally loaded terms like “DISASTER”, accompanied by much yelling and arm waving. But when I asked him what the implications were, he sort of shrugged and said “Oh, we just ended up throwing a bunch of interns at the problem—it’s actually working pretty well.”\n\nSo someone can try to blow out a problem out of proportion but asking them What are the implications? can reveal that maybe that is not really a big problem.\n\n\nRule of  thumb: Some problems don’t (actually) matter.\n\n\nTalk me through the last time that happened.\n\n“show, not tell” → whenever possible, you want to be shown, not told by your customers\nGet as close to the real action as you can. Seeing it first hand can provide unique insight into murky situations. But if you can’t get in there, asking them to talk you through the last time it happened still offers many of the benefits.\nRule of  thumb: Watching someone do a task will show you where the problems and inefficiencies really are, not where the customer thinks they are.\n\n\nWhat else have you tried?\n\nWhat are they using now?\nHow much does it cost and what do they love and hate about it?\nHow much would those fixes be worth and how big of a pain would it be for them to switch to a new solution?\nWhen’s the last time this came up?\nDid you google around for any other ways to solve it?\nRule of  thumb: If they haven’t looked for ways of solving it already, they’re not going to look for (or buy) yours.\n\n\nWould you pay X for a product which did Y?\n\nLet’s fix it: As always, ask about what they currently do now, not what they believe they might do in the future. Common wisdom is that you price your product in terms of value to the customer rather than cost to you. That’s true. And you can’t quantify the value received without prodding their financial worldview.\nliterally ask for money:\n\nIf you have the deposit or pre-order in hand, you know they were telling the truth.\n\n\n\n\nHow are you dealing with it now?\n\nBeyond workflow information, this gives you a price anchor. If they’re paying £100/month for a duct-tape workaround, you know which ballpark you’re playing in. On the other hand, they may have spent £120,000 this year on agency fees to maintain a site you’re replacing. If that’s the case, you don’t want to be having the £100 conversation.\nRule of  thumb: While it’s rare for someone to tell you precisely what they’ll pay you, they’ll often show you what it’s worth to them.\n\n\nWhere does the money come from?\n\nLeads to a conversation about whose budget the purchase will come from and who else within their company holds the power to torpedo the deal.\nOften, you’ll find yourself talking to someone other than the budget owner.\n\n\nIs there anything else I should have asked?\n\nAsking this question gives the people being interviewed a chance to politely “fix” your line of questioning. And they will!\nThis question is a bit of a crutch: you’ll discard it as you get better at asking good questions and as you get to know the industry.\nRule of  thumb: People want to help you, but they rarely do so unless you give them an excuse to do so.\n\n\n\nAvoiding Bad Data\nThings to watch out for\n\nCompliments\nFluff (generics, hypotheticals, and the future)\nIdeas\n\nWhat to do in conversation with compliments\n\nAlways ignore compliments and ask them to walk you through the current workflow that they have\nQuestion such as:\n\nCan you talk me through how it actually all fits together?\nWhat sort of difficulties have come up with that solution?\n\n\n\nDifference between data and compliment\n\nWhy did that person like the idea?\nHow much money would it save him?\nHow would it fit into his life?\nWhat else has he tried which failed to solve his problem?\nNot being able to answer these questions means that you’ve got a compliment instead of real data.\n\nWhat question to not ask since they bias the interviewee?\n\n“Do you ever…”\n“Would you ever…”\n“What do you usually…”\n“Do you think you…”\n“Might you…”\n“Could you see yourself…”\nInstead ask about the past and how are they solving it now?\n\nThe Pathos Problem\n\nOnce someone detects that your ego is on the line, they’ll give you fluffy mis-truths and extra compliments.

(e.g. IQ for intelligence) → relates to reliability\nInternal validity: are causal relations between variables real? (e.g. does rising amount of storks in cities influence the rising birth-rate in cities or not?) → relates to causality\nExternal validity: can results be generalized beyond the research context? (e.g. does a study on HRM within the Coca Cola company also apply on Procter and Gamble?)\nEcological validity: are social scientific findings applicable in everyday? (e.g. questionnaire might be filled in different than how it goes in real life)\n\n\n\nThese methods have mainly to do with quantitative research. However, ecological validity have relevance to both quantitative and qualitative research.\nAlternative criteria in qualitative research (because the above are inapplicable and inappropriate for qualitative research): Trustworthiness consists of four criteria, which has an equivalent criterion in quantitative research\n\nCredibility: parallels internal validity - how believable are the findings?\nTransferability: parallels external validity - do the findings apply to other contexts?\nDependability: parallels reliability - are the findings likely to apply at other times?\nConfirmability: parallels objectivity - has the investigator allowed his/her values to intrude to a high degree?\n\nA possible type that can be added to the list would be relevance (is the topic of contribution to the existing literature in this field?).\nQuantitative research is often based on principles of naturalism, which means that the researcher seeks to collect data in naturally occurring situations and environments.\nResearch designs\nFive different types will be examined:\n\nExperimental design\nCross-sectional or social survey design\nLongitudinal design\nCase study design\nComparative design\n\nExperimental design: laboratory and field experiments\nTrue field experiments are relatively rare in business and management research. True experiments tend to be very strong in terms of internal validity.\nQuantitative:\nIn order to conduct a true experiment, it is necessary to manipulate the independent variable in order to determine whether it has an influence on the dependent variable.\n\nDependent (not manipulated) and independent (manipulated)\nDuring an experiment you always make two experiment groups that are each going to be tested on different levels of an independent variable. However, often variables with which business cases are concerned, cannot be manipulated (entails intervening in a situation to determine which of two things happens to subjects).\n\nIt is more common to find field experiments in which a scenario is employed as a substitute for a real life setting and not laboratory experiments where experiments take place in laboratories and artificial environment where conditions are much easier to control.\nClassical experimental design = two groups are established, which forms basis for experimental manipulation of independent variable\n\nThe experimental group, or treatment group, receives the treatment and it is compared against the control group, who does not receive the treatment.\nDependent variable is measured before and after the treatment, a before-and-after analysis can be conducted\n\n5 major treats of internal validity with experimental design:\n\nTesting - the possibility that subjects may become sensitized to the aims of the experiment\nHistory - the possibility that events in the experimental environment that are unrelated to manipulation of the independent variable may have caused the changes\nMaturation - people can change along the research\nSelection - if they are chosen randomly changes can arise between control and experimental group\nAmbiguity about the direction of causal influence - there might be no connection between independent and dependent variable\nPresence of a control group coupled with random assignment allows us to eliminate these threats.\n\n5 major treats of external validity (generalizability) with experimental design:\n\nSelection - to what social and psychological groups can a finding be generalized?\nSetting - can the results of a study also be applied to other settings?\nHistory - can the findings be generalized to the past and to the future?\nEffects of pre-testing - can it also be applied to people who are not pre-tested?\nEffects of experimental arrangements - are the results the same for people who are not watched? (Hawthorne effect: awareness by people of being watched influenced results)\n\nAn advantage of field experiments is their high ecological validity.\nIn a laboratory experiment the researcher has a higher level of control over experimental arrangement, and this is likely to enhance the internal validity of the study and it will be more straightforward to replicate.\nHowever, there are some limitations:\n\nExternal validity is likely to be difficult to establish\nOften worked with volunteers, and volunteers differ from non-volunteers\nLow ecological validity\n\nQuasi-experiment: a research design that is close to being an experiment but that does not meet the requirements fully and therefore does not exhibit complete internal validity. For example:\n\nNot random assignment for group A or B because of important dependent variables\nNo control group\n\nA central feature of any experiment is the fact that it entails a comparison: at the very least it entails a comparison of results obtained by an experimental group with those engendered by a control group. 2 Cross-sectional design: comparison of more cases at a given point in time\n2 Cross-sectional design: comparison of more cases at a given point in time\nCross-sectional design entails the collection of data on more than one case (usually quite a lot more than one) and at a single point in time in order to collect a body of quantitative and quantifiable data in connection with two or more variables (usually quite more than two), which are then examined to detect patterns of association.\n\nReplicability is likely to be present\nInternal validity is typically weak\nEcological validity may be jeopardized\n\nSurvey research = research that employs a cross-sectional design and in which data are collected by questionnaire or by structured interview\nMost quantitative business research employs a cross-sectional research design rather than an experimental one, because then it is possible to manipulate the variables in which we are interested.\nQualitative research often entails a form of cross-sectional design, like unstructured interviewing or semi-structured interviewing with a number of people.\n3 Longitudinal design: same sample is surveyed at different point in time (to map change)\nLongitudinal design: sample is surveyed and is then surveyed again on at least one further occasion However, they are very time consuming and expensive and therefore not often used in business research.\nThe longitudinal design is little different from cross-sectional research. However, because longitudinal research is done over a longer period of time more conclusions about causal inferences can be made.\nThere are two types of longitudinal design\n\nPanel study: the same participants are used throughout a panel study\nCohort study: different participants (with certain characteristics, like just married) are used throughout a cohort study\n\nCase study design\nCase study entails the detailed and intensive analysis of a single case. A case can be\n\nA single organization\nA single location\nA person\nA single event\n\nGoal: concentrate on uniqueness of the case and to develop a deep understanding of its complexity\nWhat distinguishes a case study from other research designs is the focus on a bounded situation or system, an entity with a purpose and functioning parts.\n➔ Case studies are often associated with qualitative methods\nWith a case study, the case is an object of interest in its own right, and the researcher aims to provide an in-depth elucidation of it.\nCase study has a ideographic approach (highlights unique features of a case) instead of a nomothetic approach as for example cross-sectional designs that look for generating statements that apply regardless of time and place.\nThree different goals of case study\n\nIntrinsic case studies : undertaken to gain insight into the particularities of a situation\nInstrumental case studies : focus on using case as a means of understanding a broader issue\nMultiple or collective case studies : focus on exploring a general phenomenon\n\nDeductive or inductive? Just like with cross-sectional design:\n\nIf case study is researched with qualitative research strategy, approach tends to be inductive.\nIf case study is researched with quantitative research strategy, approach tends to be deductive.\n\nTypes of cases\n\nCritical case - a case based on a hypothesis\nUnique case - a common focus on clinical studies\nRevelatory case - explore a new development that has not been researched before\nRepresentative (or typical case) - explore the everyday situation\nLongitudinal case - how situations change over time\n\nMultiple-case study designs have become increasingly common in business research. They allow the researcher to compare and contrast the findings deriving from each of the cases.\n➔ With multiple-case study design, the emphasis is on individual cases; with a cross-sectional design, it is on the samples of cases.\nComparative design\nComparative design entails the study using more or less identical methods on two or more contrasting cases\n\nMay be realized in context of quantitative or qualitative research\nThere are at least two cases and data are collected from each, usually within a cross- sectional format\n\nDistinguish is made between:\n\nCross-cultural approaches (compare national management systems and local business customers in various countries)\nIntercultural approaches (focus on study of interaction between people and organizations with different national/cultural backgrounds)\n\nIn terms of issues of reliability, validity, replicability and generalizability, the comparative study is no different from the cross-sectional design.\n➔ The comparative design is essentially two or more cross-sectional studies carried out at more or less the same point in time.\nThe key to the comparative design is its ability to allow the distinguishing characteristics of two or more cases to act as a springboard for theoretical reflections about contrasting findings.\nQuantitative comparative design: often takes form of cross-sectional design Qualitative comparative design: often takes form of case study design (multiple)\nQualitative comparative design: often takes form of case study design (multiple)\nLevel of analysis\nResearch can be done on different levels, often revered as SOGI model:\n\nIndividuals (e.g. managers, employees, etc.)\nGroups (e.g. HRM department, board of directors, etc.)\nOrganizations (e.g. workplace, salaries, etc.)\nSocieties (e.g. national, political context of the company)\n\nOften mixed methods research is used, where quantitative and qualitative methods are combined.\nBringing research strategy and research design together\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResearch designResearch strategyResearch strategyQuantitativeQualitativeExperimentalTypical form: Most researchers using an experimental design employ quantitative comparisons between experimental and control groups with regard to the dependent variableNo typical form: The Hawthorne experiments provide an example of experimental research design that gradually moved away from the ‘test room method’ towards the use of more qualitative methodsCross-sectionalTypical form : Social survey research or structured observation on a sample at a single point in time.

The nature of quantitative research\nIntroduction\nQuantitative research is a distinctive research strategy. It’s about entailing the collection of numerical data and exhibiting view of the relationship between theory and research as deductive, a predilection of a natural science approach (and of positivism in particular), and as having an objectivist conception of social reality.\nThe main steps in quantitative research\nQuantitative research is a linear series of steps moving from theory to conclusions, but the process described in the figure is an ideal type from which there may be many departures.\nGood deal of quantitative research does not require the specification of hypothesis.\nFor variables that are not readily measured in numbers, quantification will entail coding the information (transforming it into numbers).\nA significant part of the research process involves convincing others of the significance and validity of one’s findings.\nConcepts and their measurements\nConcepts are building blocks of theory and represent points around which business research is conducted. Bulmer: Concepts are categories for organization of ideas and observations. (Concept = intelligence and IQ = measurement of the concept intelligence).\nIf a concept is to be employed in quantitative research, it will have to be measured. Once they are measured, concepts can be in the form of independent or dependent variables.\n➔ In other words, concepts may provide an explanation of a certain aspect of the social world (independent variables), or they stand for things we want to explain (dependent variables).\nMeasures are quantities. The measurement process entails the search for indicators. Three reasons for preoccupation with measurement in quantitative research:\n\nMeasurement allows us to delineate fine differences between people, organizations, or other entities in terms of the characteristic in question.\nMeasurement gives us a consistent device or yardstick for making such distinctions. A measurement device provides a consistent instrument for gauging differences. This consistency relates to our ability to be consistent over time and with other researchers\nMeasurement provides the basis for more precise estimates of the degree of relationship between concepts\n\nIn order to provide a measure of concept (operational definition), it is necessary to have an indicator or indicators that will stand for the concept. There are many ways in which indicators can be devised:\n\nThrough a question that is part of a structured interview schedule or self-completion questionnaire\nThrough the recording of individuals’ behavior using a structured observation schedule\nThrough the use of existing surveys\nThrough an examination of mass media content by way of content analysis\n\nThe use of multiple-indicator measures reflects the fact that some phenomena are multi-dimensional. The main reason for using a multiple-indicator measure of a concept is a recognition that there are potential problems with a reliance on just a single indicator:\n\nA single indicator will incorrectly classify many individuals or organizations.\nOne indicator may capture only a portion of the underlying concept or to be too general.\nYou can make much finer distinctions.\n\nReliability of measures\nReliability refers to the consistency of a measure of a concept. The following are three prominent factors involved when considering whether a measure is reliable:\n\nStability: entails asking whether a measure is stable over time, so that we can be confident that the results relating to that measure for a sample of respondents do not fluctuate\n\nTest-retest method\nInvolves administering a test or measure on one occasion and then re-administering it to the sample on another occasion\nWe should expect to find a high correlation between the two occasions: correlation is a measure of the strength of the relationship between two variables\n\n\nInternal reliability: key issue whether the indicators that make up the scale or index for a concept are consistent among themselves\n\nWhether or not respondents’ scores on any one indicator tend to be related to their scores on the other indicators associated with that concept\nCronbach’s alpha is used as test of internal reliability. It essentially calculates the average of all split-half reliability coefficients. A computed alpha coefficient will vary between 1 (perfect internal reliability) and 0 (no internal reliability) the figure 0.8 is rule of thumb to denote an acceptable level of internal reliability.\n\n\nInter-rater reliability: when a great deal of subjective judgement is involved in the recording of observations or the translation of data into categories\n\nWhere more than one rater is involved in such activities, there is the possibility that there is a lack of consistency in their decisions.\n\n\n\nValidity of measures\nValidity refers to the issue of whether or not an indicator (or set of indicators) that is devised to gauge a concept really measures that concept.\nHere, validity is being used as a shorthand for what was referred to as measurement validity.\nA distinction is made between number of types of validity:\n- Face validity - the measure apparently reflects the content of the concept in question. People might be asked to act as judges to determine whether or not on the face of it the measure seems to reflect the concept concerned. It is an essentially intuitive process.\n- Concurrent validity - the researcher employs a criterion on which cases are known to differ and that is relevant to the concept in question\n- Predictive validity - the researcher uses a future criterion measure, rather than a contemporary one, as in the case of concurrent validity\n- Convergent validity - comparing it to measures of the same concept developed through other methods\n- Discriminant validity - ensuring that when a measure is used for one construct it is different in terms of its content from a measure used to measure another construct\nThe connection between reliability and validity\nIt should be borne in mind that, although reliability and validity are analytically distinguishable, they are related because validity presumes reliability. This means that if your measure is not reliable, it cannot be valid.\nThe main preoccupations of quantitative researchers\nQuantitative research can be characterized as exhibiting certain preoccupations:\n\nMeasurement\n\nFrom position of quantitative research, measurement carries some advantages.\nIssues of reliability and validity are a concern for quantitative researchers.\n\n\nCausality\n\nThere is a very strong concern with causal explanation in most quantitative research. Quantitative researchers are rarely content merely to describe how things are, but are keen to say why things are the way they are.\nResearchers are likely to want to explain the phenomenon, which means examining its causes.\nThe idea of independent and dependent variables reflect the tendency to think in terms of causes and effects (independent variable = manipulated).\nA criterion of good quantitative research is frequently the extent to which there is confidence in the researcher’s causal inferences.\n\n\nGeneralization\n\nIn quantitative research the researcher usually hopes to be able to say that his/her findings can be generalized beyond the confines of the particular context in which the research was conducted (probability sampling)\n\n\nReplication\n\nThe results of a piece of research should be unaffected by the researcher’s special characteristics or expectations.\nIt is often regarded as important that the researcher spells out clearly his or her procedures so that they can be replicated by others, even if the research does not end up being replicated.\n\n\n\nThe critique of quantitative research\nFour criticisms of quantitative research, which revolve around the view that a natural science model is inappropriate for studying the social world.\n\nQuantitative researchers fail to distinguish people and social institutions from ‘the world of nature’.\nThe measurement process possesses an artificial and spurious sense of precision and accuracy.\nThe reliance on instruments and procedures hinders the connection between research and everyday life.\nThe analysis of relationships between variables creates a static view of social life that is independent of people’s lives.\n\nIs it always like this?\nOne of the problems with characterizing any research strategy, research design, or research method is that to a certain extent one is always outlining an ideal-typical approach. One tends to create something that represents that strategy, design or method, but that may not be reflected in its entirely research practice. This gap between the ideal type and actual practice can arise as a result of at least two major considerations.\n\nIt arises because those of us write about and teach research methods cannot cover every eventuality that can arise in the process of business research.\nIt arises because to a very large extent when writing about and teaching research methods, we are essentially providing an account of good practice.\n\nReverse operationism\nDeductive view of research (‘operationism’) neglects the fact that measurement entails much more of an inductive element. Sometimes, measures are developed that in turn lead to conceptualization.\nReliability and validity testing\nSecond reason why the gap between the ideal type and actual research practice can arise is because researchers do not always follow recommended practices. The reasons why the procedures for determining stability and validity are rarely used are almost certainly the cost and time that are likely to be involved.\nSampling\nGood practice is strongly associated with the use of random or probability samples. However, quite a lot of research is based on non-probability samples due to the impossibility or extreme difficulty of obtaining probability samples. Another reason is that the time and cost involved in securing a probability sample are too great relative to the level of resources available and sometimes the opportunity to study a certain group presents itself and represents too good an opportunity to miss\n15. Quantitative data analysis\nIntroduction\nQuantitative data analysis occurs typically at a late stage in the process and is a distinct stage, but that does not mean that you should not be considering how you will analyse your data until then.\nYou should be fully aware of what techniques you will apply during the data analysis in a fairly early stage for two main reasons:\n\nYou cannot apply just any technique to any variable.\nThe size and nature of your sample are likely to impose limitations on the kinds of techniques you can use.\n\nDecisions that you make at an early stage in the research process, such as kinds of data you collect and size of sample, will have implications for the sorts of analysis that you will be able to conduct.\nA small research project\nMissing data arise when respondents fail to reply to a question - either by accident or because they do not want to answer the question (coded as a zero (0)).\nTypes of variable\nThere are four main types of variables:\n\nInterval / ratio variables: variables where the distances between the categories are identical across the range of categories (internal variables have a fixed zero point)\nOrdinal variables: variables whose categories can be rank ordered but the distances between the categories are not equal across the range\nNominal variables: variables also known as categorical variables, comprise categories that cannot be rank ordered\nDichotomous variables: variables that contain data that have only two categories\n\nUnivariate analysis\nUnivariate analysis refers to the analysis of one variable at a time.\nThe commonest approaches\n\nFrequency tables: provides the number of people and the percentage belonging to each of the categories for the variable in question\n\nCan be used in relation to all the different types of variable\n\n\nDiagrams: most frequently used methods of displaying quantitative data\n\nRelatively easy to interpret and understand\nBar chart of pie chart: nominal or ordinal variables\nHistogram: interval/ratio variables\n\n\nMeasures of central tendency: encapsulate in one figure a value that is typical for a distribution of values. In effect, we are seeking out an average for a distribution, but in quantitative data analysis three different forms of average are recognized:\n\nArithmetic mean: add all values in a distribution and then divide by the number of values, vulnerable to outliers\n\n Internal/ratio variables (ordinal)\n\n\nMedian: mid-point in a distribution of values, it is derived by arraying all values in a distribution from smallest to largest and finding the middle point\n\n Internal/ratio &amp; ordinalAnother measure of dispersion is standard deviation: average amount of variation around mean, calculated by taking differences between each value in a distribution and the mean and then dividing the total of differences by number of values\n\n\nMode: value that occurs most frequently in a distribution\n\n\nMeasures of dispersion: amount of variation in a sample can be just as interesting as providing estimates of the typical value of a distribution\n\nMost obvious way of measuring dispersion is by the range.\nAnother measure of dispersion is standard deviation: average amount of variation around mean, calculated by taking differences between each value in a distribution and the mean and then dividing the total of differences by number of values\nPopular type of figure is the boxplot, which provides an indication of both central tendency (median) and dispersion (range) and indicates the outliers\n\n\n\nBivariate analysis\nBivariate analysis is concerned with the analysis of two variables at a time to uncover whether the two variables are related. Exploring relationships between variables means searching for evidence that the variation in one variables coincides with variation in another variable. A variety of techniques is available for examining relationships, but use depends on nature of two variables being analyzed.\nAn important point to bear in mind about all of the methods for analyzing relationships between variables is that it is precisely relationships that they uncover.\nContingency tables are probably the most flexible of all methods of analyzing relationships in that they can be employed in relation to any pair of variables. A contingency table is like a frequency table, but it allows two variables to be simultaneously analyzed so that relationships between the two variables can be examined. Users of contingency tables often present the presumed independent variable as column variable and dependent variable as rows variable.\nPearson’s r is a method for examining relationships between interval/ratio variables.\n\nThe coefficient will almost certainly lie between 0 (no relationship) and 1 or -1 (perfect relationship) - this indicates the strength of a relationship.\nThe closer the coefficient is to 1, the stronger the relationship.\nThe coefficient will be positive or negative - this indicates the direction of a relationship. In order to be able to use Pearson’s r, the relationship between two variables must be broadly linear - that is, when plotted on a scatter diagram, the values of two variables approximate to a straight line.\n\nPhi and Cramér’s V are two closely related statistics:\n\nThe phi coefficient is used for the analysis of the relationship between two dichotomous variables. It results in a computed statistic that varies between 0 and +1 or -1.\nCramér’s V uses a similar formula to phi and can be employed with nominal variables. However, this statistic can take on only a positive value, so that it can give an indication only of the strength of the relationship between two variables, not the direction. It is usually reported along with a contingency table and chi square test.\n\nIf you need to examine the relationship between an interval/ratio variable and a nominal variable, and if the latter can be relatively unambiguously identified as the independent variable, a potentially fruitful approach is to compare the means of the interval/ratio variable for each subgroup of the nominal variable. This procedure is often accompanied by a test of association between variables called eta. This statistic expresses the level of association between the two variables and will always be positive.\nMultivariate analysis\nMultivariate analysis entails the simultaneous analysis of three or more variables. There are three main contexts within which multivariate analysis might be employed.\n\nCould the relationship be spurious?\n\nSpurious relationship exists when there appears to be a relationship between two variables, but the relationship is not real: it is being produced because each variable is itself related to a third variable.\n\n\nCould there be an intervening variable?\n\nAn intervening variable allows us to answer questions about the bivariate relationship between variables\nIt suggests that the relationship between the two variables is not a direct one.\n\n\nCould a third variable moderate the relationship?\n\nDoes the relationship between two variables hold for men but not for woman? If it does, the relationship is said to be moderated by gender.\n\n\n\nStatistical significance\nOne difficulty with working on data deriving from a sample is that there is often the lingering worry that, your findings will not be generalizable to the population from which the sample is drawn. What you can do to provide an indication of how confident you can be that your findings can be generalized to the population from which that sample was selected → statistical significance.\nA test of statistical significance allows the analyst to estimate how confident he or she can be that the results deriving from a study based on a randomly selected sample are generalizable to the population from which the sample was drawn. It also tells us about the risk of concluding that there is in fact a relationship in the population when there is no such relationship in the population.\nCommon structure of all of the tests:\n\nSet up a null hypothesis (no relationship in the population between two variables)\nEstablish the level of statistical significance that you find acceptable = measure of the degree of risk that you might reject the null hypothesis when you should support it. Levels are expressed as probability levels. (p &lt; 0,05 is acceptable)\nDetermine the statistical significance of your findings = use a statistical test like chi-square If p &lt;0,05, you would reject the null hypothesis. Therefore, you are implying that the results are unlikely to have occurred by chance.\n\nThere are in fact two types of error that can be made when inferring statistical significance:\nChi-square test: applied to contingency tables and allows us to establish how confident we can be that there is a relationship between two variables in the population.\n\n Test works by calculating for each cell in the table an expected frequency of value - that is, one that would occur on the basis of chance alone.\n\nExamining the statistical significance of a computed correlation coefficient, which is based on a randomly selected sample, provides information about the likelihood that the coefficient will be found in the population from which the sample was taken. Whether a correlation coefficient is statistically significant or not will be affected by two factors:\n\nSize of computed coefficient\nSize of sample\n\nComparing means and statistical significance entails treating the total amount of variation in the dependent variable as made up of two types: variation within the four subgroups that make up the independent variable, and variation between them. The latter is often called explained variance and former the error variance."},"Maastricht/2025/moving/What-to-sell":{"slug":"Maastricht/2025/moving/What-to-sell","filePath":"Maastricht/2025/moving/What to sell.md","title":"What to sell","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"\nNevi’s kettle\nThe desk\nthe chair\nthe speakers\nheadphones from Deni\n"},"Maastricht/2025/q1/entrepreneurship--and--innovation/ASML/ASML-Presentation":{"slug":"Maastricht/2025/q1/entrepreneurship--and--innovation/ASML/ASML-Presentation","filePath":"Maastricht/2025/q1/entrepreneurship & innovation/ASML/ASML Presentation.md","title":"ASML Presentation","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Opportunities\nGrowing demand for advanced semiconductors\n\n\nThere is a giant opportunity ASML because the growth of\n\nAutomotive (21% CAGR)\n\nIC growth\nprocessing unit\nGPU\nvehicle-to-everything communication\n\n\nIndustrial electronics (14% CAGR)\n\nedge processors/sensors\n\n\nHigh-bandwidth connectivity (10% CAGR)\n\n5G\n6G\n\n\nServers/data centers and storage (12% CAGR)\n\nmemory growth\nGPU for AI\nprocessor growth\n\n\n\n\n\nExpansion into emerging markets\n\n\nCurrently China is a big emerging market, but ASML could further focus on satisfying all the demand since the demand is bigger than the supply.\nNext “rest of asia” category is very small compared to the other but Vietnam is emerging as a chip producer and has an ambition to train 50k engineers and build 6 chip producing factories till 2050.

For new ventures, it is not possible to estimate the cost of equity (K e) as we might do for established firms. In general, the cost of equity is calculated using the CAPM model\n\n\n\nDividend-based valuation\n\ninterest payments  are subtracted from the FCF. And to discount the cash flows to the present instead of using the cost of capital (WACC), we apply the cost of the equity\ncan only be used in mature companies that are already paying out dividends.

These investors are more concerned with the size of the company in the future, assuming that all goes well. ‘Are we looking at a €10 million business in three years, or is this more a €100 million or even €500 million company?’\nventure capitalists raise funds from different sources, such as the financial sector, corporations, government funds, university endowments or wealthy individuals\n\ncapital providers in the fund are referred to as Limited Partners or LPs\nfund managers, or General Partners (GPs), contractually agree to a certain type of investments with their LPs\n\n\nAgreements between LPs and GPs:\n\nMaximum/minimum amount of money invested per (portfolio) company\nActivity/sector: the fund can be more generalist, like an investor in ‘technology’, or more specific, for example, an investor in ‘apps’ or ‘mobile apps’.\nGeography: a city, a region, a country or continent\nStage of the company: pre-prototype; with prototype; first customers (maybe given free access to test the prototype); sales over a certain amount (for example, €1 million); market position; expanding internationally, or pre-IPO\nTarget stake in the venture (percentage that they will consider, for example, 20 per cent to 30 per cent).\nType of deal: seed; series A, B, C, or late stage.\nFor example, the strategy of venture capital fund ABC could be ‘investments in software companies in the south of Europe, with a proven prototype and a first beta tester, looking to raise between €2 and €4 million, for a 20 to 35 per cent share in the company’. That means that ABC can only invest in companies that meet these characteristics. Even if the partners of the ABC fund find an interesting opportunity that they would love to invest in, if it is outside the defined scope, they are not allowed to do so\nTime horizon: venture capital investment should be returned within a specific (relatively short) period (QUESTION: What % return do LPs want?) Having an ‘exit strategy’ is always a must. **(QUESTION: Isn’t the exit strategy always the same, trying to rase further?)) **\nIn general, equity investors in startups expect a return in the range of 40 to 60 per cent for early-stage deals and more technology-based companies, and a lower range, of between 30 and 40 per cent, in later-stage and less disruptive companies.\n\n\nIRR calculation\n\nReturnInvestment = IntiailInvestment * (1+IRR)^{YearOfExit}\nExample:\n\nIntialInvestment = 1 000 000 EUR\nDesiredIRR = 40\\% \nYearOfExit=5\nReturnInvestment = 1 000 000 * (1 + 0.4)^5\nReturnInvestment = 5 378 240\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIncome/Sales\n\nBottom-up approach: Understand the selling process and start building from zero. For example, in an internet B2C business, key variables would be: investment in online ads, number of click-throughs, number of potential customers, number of buyers, average shopping basket, repeat customers, and so on. Basically, it is about following the sales funnel. For a B2B the focus could be on the number of sales people in the company, calls per day, visits per week, successful visits, time to close a sale, average sale per customer, and so on\nTop-down approach: Alternately, if we know the size of the market, we could try to estimate the market share that the company will own in year ‘n’. Investors prefer to treat this approach as complementary as a reality check. For example, a business angel might ask one of the founders,  ‘according to the figures that you are presenting today, what would your market  share be by year 5?’ With this question, the investor is trying to understand whether the numbers make sense. Of course, if your venture is a ‘copycat’,  or it is an innovation within a well-established market, then this approach  alone might be appropriate\n\nThe Real Option Method\n\n\nFlexibility in Decision-Making: Treats investments as options, not obligations.\nTypes: Expansion, abandonment, delay, and switching options.\nValuation: Uses models like Black-Scholes or binomial trees.\nApplication: Useful in capital intensive, uncertain environments like tech, natural resources, and pharmaceuticals.\nBenefit: Captures value from managerial flexibility.\nChallenge: Complexity in modeling and forecasting.\n\nThe Venture Capital Method\n\nThe First Chicago Method\n\nModified DCF\n\nTop Down\nBottom Up\n"},"Maastricht/2025/q2/Entrepreneurial-Finance/Tutorial-3/Question-and-answers":{"slug":"Maastricht/2025/q2/Entrepreneurial-Finance/Tutorial-3/Question-and-answers","filePath":"Maastricht/2025/q2/Entrepreneurial Finance/Tutorial 3/Question and answers.md","title":"Question and answers","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Questions\n\nWhat is entrepreneurial orientation?\n\nhas been defined as a firm’s propensity to “engage[] in product-market innovation, undertake[] somewhat risky ventures, and […] come up with ‘proactive’ innovations, beating competitors to the punch\n\n\nWhat link is there between giving up equity, and firm quality?\n\nA high-quality start-up firm is more likely to obtain business debt than a low-quality start-up firm.\nA high-quality start-up firm is less likely to obtain personal debt than a low-quality start-up firm.\n\n\nWhat is the problem with incomplete contracts?\n\ncontract enforcement and property protection are not the only source of investor protection\n\n\nHow can the role of asymmetric information be mitigated?\n\nFor example, Kaplan and Strömberg (2001) report that venture capital contracts allocate cash flow rights, voting control, and decision rights. Bergemann and Hege’s (1998) model shows that a time-varying contract (i.e., finance staging) between entrepreneurs and investors is optimal because it provides information to close the asymmetric information problem\nentrepreneur monitoring\nentrepreneur screenig\ncontract enforcement\nprivate equity providers are better at coping with information asymmetries surrounding new ventures, as they are more prone to employ non-traditional methods in assessing firms’ future value where they consider not only financial start-ups’ characteristics, but also non-financial ones (business prospect, alliances, top management team characteristics, etc.)\nstrategy–environment fit will be even more important before start-ups’ break-even (when the issue of information asymmetries is the most acute)\nbusiness plans may serve as a primary source of information not only on objective firm characteristics, but also on a firm’s level of EO\n\n\nWhat are the sources of finance available to nascent entrepreneurs?\n\nequity\n\na start-up’s ability to attract external equity capital is often regarded as a sign of quality\n\n\ndebt\n\nA high-quality start-up firm is more likely to obtain business debt than a low-quality start-up firm.\nA high-quality start-up firm is less likely to obtain personal debt than a low-quality start-up firm.\nA firm that obtains debt at the firm’s start-up exhibits superior future performance outcomes compared to a firm that obtains no debt at start-up.\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the difference between institutional and informal investors?\n\ninstitutional investors rely on the experience of entrepreneurs in managing start-ups and the quality of investor protection to reduce moral hazard\ninformal investors are also common in initial start-up funding. They tend to be attracted to the type of products in the new firm. In comparison, informal investors are likely to have a social relationship with the entrepreneur, and thus have information about that person’s skill and character, which renders entrepreneurial experience less important\n\n\nWhat is the problem with incomplete contracts?\n\nAsymmetric Information\nIncomplete Contracts (impossible to foresee all future contingencies or because specifying all possible states of the world would be prohibitively costly or complex)\nMoral Hazard\n\none party takes on risks because they do not bear the full consequences of their actions, or they can act in ways that are hidden from the other party\n\n\nAgency Problems\n\nThe CEO’s compensation package might include a significant portion of stock options and then stop R&amp;D to decrease cost short term but the firm will suffer long-term.

When determining information characteristics, our evidence shows that informal investors are more likely to prefer start-ups that produce new products. In sharp contrast, institutions prefer to invest in existing products. In addition, our evidence also shows that institutions are more willing to provide capital if the initial start-ups are managed by an experienced entrepreneur. Production technology is irrelevant in their financing decision. Based on the interaction between investor protection and start-up firm characteristics, we find that firm characteristics affect the likelihood of obtaining external financing significantly, while investor protection shows a marginal effect. Institutional willingness to fund new product ventures increases in a strong investor protection environment, and relies more heavily on entrepreneur experience in low legal protection environments.\n\n\nSources of funding\n\nequity\n\na start-up’s ability to attract external equity capital is often regarded as a sign of quality\n\n\ndebt\n\nA high-quality start-up firm is more likely to obtain business debt than a low-quality start-up firm.\nA high-quality start-up firm is less likely to obtain personal debt than a low-quality start-up firm.\nA firm that obtains debt at the firm’s start-up exhibits superior future performance outcomes compared to a firm that obtains no debt at start-up.\n\n\n\n\nContracts\n\ncontract enforcement and property protection are not the only source of investor protection\n\n\n\nself-selection - the founder already believes their business and filters himself if he is not convinced thus applies to personal loan - high-selection\nhigh-selection - screening, monitoring, filtering (LaRocca Information assymetry)\nselection by banks - creditworthiness\nYou get a text, I get this information, I would apply this evaluation.\nKohl - business loans, personal loan\nLaRoco - information asymetry, moral hazzard, liffecycle (the lifecycle is dependent on the industry)\nMonitoring by lenders - business bank credit ,  business street credit (suppliers, interested in product, able to monitor you)\ntransparency - information opacity\nentrepreneurs should focus on securing business bank credit.\nNon random sample\nodd’s ratio = exposure / outcome\nNofsinger ⇒ overcoming information assymetry and moral hazard\n\nstaging of capital\nrisk sharing solutions\n\nsignals - product type, experience\nlogit regression - the chance of sth\npage 442 (why startups prefer equity over debt)\nwhat is the contingency approach?\ngovernment sources of finance\ncertification effect signalling\nInstrumental variable approach\nSurvival analysis"},"Maastricht/2025/q2/Entrepreneurial-Finance/Tutorial-4/Presentation":{"slug":"Maastricht/2025/q2/Entrepreneurial-Finance/Tutorial-4/Presentation","filePath":"Maastricht/2025/q2/Entrepreneurial Finance/Tutorial 4/Presentation.md","title":"Presentation","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"\n\nWhat advantages does crowdfunding offer compared to traditional financing?\n\nKeeps the control inside of the hands of the founder\nLiquid investments\n\n\n\n\nWhat are “extra benefits” of crowdfunding?\n\nVisibility and Marketing (free marketing)\nMarket validation\nFeedback and engagement from community\nnetwork opportunities\nless information asymmetry\ndemocratization of investment\n\n\n\nWhat are the benefits of GreenWave relying on the collective feedback of its backers and how is this phenomenon called?\n\n“Wisdom of the crowd” → average of the random Joe is better than experienced investor\n\n\n\nproxy voting\ngovernance behind crowdfunding\nconversation of cooperation is low\nbenefits between angel invester and VC to benefits of crowsfunding\nLenon’s problem"},"Maastricht/2025/q2/Entrepreneurial-Finance/Tutorial-6/Tutorial-6":{"slug":"Maastricht/2025/q2/Entrepreneurial-Finance/Tutorial-6/Tutorial-6","filePath":"Maastricht/2025/q2/Entrepreneurial Finance/Tutorial 6/Tutorial 6.md","title":"Tutorial 6","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Dai, N., Ivanov, V., &amp; Cole, R.

Banks face informational asymmetry problems and related adverse selection and moral hazard problems when dealing with entrepreneurial firms. Adverse selection refers to the difficulties for a bank to select good credit risks ex-ante when it lacks information about the quality of the borrower\n\n\nWhy entrepreneurs prefer debt if high risk?\n\nIt is the debt financed entrepreneur who captures all the upside in case of success, while an entrepreneur financed with equity has to share the upside with the other equity holders. As a result, it will be entrepreneurs establishing a high risk firm who will prefer debt financing\n\n\n\nNational / Big banks\n\nnational banks could be more cost efficient than local banks, which are typically much smaller and less diversified. This greater cost efficiency may decrease the cost of loans, including loans to informationally opaque borrowers\nForeign bank entry may be “cream skimming” whereby they lend only to the most profitable and established local firms and therefore soft information borrowers are no longer pooled\n\n\n\nwith hard information borrowers\n\n\nSmall local banks\n\nSmaller local banks may be particularly suited for relationship banking relative to larger national banks. A bank’s borrowers contract with the bank’s loan officer, who is controlled by the bank’s senior management, which in turn operates in the interests of the bank’s shareholders.\nA local bank operating in the local community, whose employees belong to the local community, and which may be owned and/or managed by local community members will have a more direct and in-depth knowledge of local firms and entrepreneurs. The local bank takes part in the life of the local community, thereby acquiring information that is not available to banks that operate at a distance\nThe diversity and specialization of local markets in Italy could make it more difficult for national actors to understand these markets, thereby fostering informational asymmetry problems-again, providing an advantage to local banks.\nlocal banks are better at reducing adverse selection and moral hazard problems in the financing of new firms.\nlocal firms give larger loans\n\n\n\nNational banks\n\nMany loans with small amount of money\n\n\n\nForeign banks\n\ngive loans only to the best firms and skip all the others\n\n\n\nHypothesis:\n\n✅ Higher overall bank branch density at the provincial level increases the use of debt financing by new firms founded in that province.\n\nConsistent with our first hypothesis, we find that new firms are more likely to use debt and attract larger amounts of debt when they are located in a province with more bank branches\n\n\n🔘 The positive effect of bank branch density on the use of debt financing by new firms is more pronounced for branches of local banks than for branches of national banks\n\nThe positive effect of bank branches on access to debt for new firms is less pronounced for local banks than for national banks, but when local banks provide debt they provide more debt to new firms than national banks\n\n\n✅ The positive effect of bank branch density on the use of debt financing by new firms is less pronounced (and my even turn negative) for branches of foreign banks than for branches of domestic banks.\n\nconsistent with our third hypothesis, we further find that the presence of foreign banks in a province has a negative effect on the use of debt by local new firms\n\n\n\n\n\nFindings\n\nOur finding that bank branch density is positively related to the use of debt raises the question how branch density affects the cost of debt.\n\nmore bank branches in a province not only make debt more accessible but also cheaper for new firms\n\n\noverall branch density has a significant negative effect on the use of trade credit\n\nnew firms use more trade credit when access to bank debt is restricted\n\n\na greater branch density facilitates access to credit for new firms\n\nwe find that debt financing is associated with a greater or similar likelihood of survival in provinces with high branch density compared to provinces with low branch density\n\n\n\n\n"},"Maastricht/2025/q2/Entrepreneurial-Finance/Tutorial-7/Business-angels":{"slug":"Maastricht/2025/q2/Entrepreneurial-Finance/Tutorial-7/Business-angels","filePath":"Maastricht/2025/q2/Entrepreneurial Finance/Tutorial 7/Business angels.md","title":"Business angels","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Angel group members’ decision process and rejection criteria: A longitudinal analysis\n\nBusiness angels (BAs) play a crucial role in financing the growth of entrepreneurial ventures\nBAs finance only a tiny proportion of the proposals they receive\nAngel group members’ (AGMs) attempt to control market and execution risk and favor an investment strategy focused on early exit that rejects inexperienced entrepreneurs\nMain rejection reasons:\n\ncompetitive conditions affecting the size, growth and accessibility of the market\nthe difficulty of execution of the product or technology\n\n\n\nyou can interpret tobit only with marginal effect\nWhat is the difference between angel investors, and angel investor groups?\nHere are the key differences between individual business angels (BAs) and members of business angel groups (AGMs):\n\nDecision Process:\n\nBAs: Less structured, often based on personal trust and intuition.\nAGMs: More structured, with defined steps and a focus on market and execution risks.\n\n\nInvestment Stage:\n\nBAs: Tend to invest in early-stage startups.\nAGMs: Focus on later-stage firms nearing commercialization.\n\n\nExit Strategy:\n\nBAs: Might not prioritize a quick exit.\nAGMs: Emphasize a clear exit strategy within a shorter time-frame.\n\n\nRejection Criteria:\n\nBAs: Reject for agency issues or personal fit.\nAGMs: Primarily reject based on market and execution risks.\n\n\nExperience Required:\n\nBAs: Can be lenient with less experienced entrepreneurs.\nAGMs: Require substantial experience in industry, management, or prior startups.\n\n\nOperational Dynamics:\n\nBAs: Make decisions independently.\nAGMs: Decisions influenced by group consensus and dynamics.\n\n\n\nStairway to heaven?

What is the “market failure” to address here?\nGovernment Intervention in the Angel Investment Market:\nFront-end incentive: Reduce of initial investment costs\nBack-end incentive: tax deferrals on exit strategy\nJustification:\n\nMarket Inefficiencies and Coordination Failures: The article suggests that government intervention is justified by the need to address market inefficiencies and coordination failures in the early-stage risk capital market. This includes:\n\nInformation Asymmetry: Where potential investors lack sufficient information about start-ups to make informed decisions.\nHigh Uncertainty: The inherent unpredictability in early-stage businesses makes private investment less forthcoming.\nAgency Costs: The costs associated with aligning the interests of investors with those of entrepreneurs.\n\n\nEncouraging Investment in High-Growth Ventures: Government policies aim to stimulate investment in ventures with high growth potential that might otherwise struggle to secure financing due to their risk profile.\nEconomic Growth and Job Creation: By facilitating more angel investments, governments hope to promote entrepreneurship, innovation, and economic growth, which can lead to job creation.\nThe Market Failure:\n\n\nCapital Market Failures: The primary market failure in the context of angel investing is the suboptimal allocation of capital due to:\n\nUnder-investment in Risky but Potentially High-Return Ventures: Due to risk aversion, investors might not naturally flow enough capital into start-ups, leading to an under-supply of funding for innovative but risky ventures.\nLack of Liquidity: The market for early-stage investments can be illiquid, deterring investment.\nExternalities: The societal benefits from new ventures (like innovation, job creation, and economic development) might not be fully captured by private returns, suggesting a role for public policy to encourage these investments.\nArguments Against Intervention:\n\n\n\n\nIneffectiveness of Tax Incentives: The article highlights studies indicating that tax credits might: - Not necessarily promote high-quality entrepreneurship. - Attract inexperienced investors (“dumb money”), leading to suboptimal allocation of funds. - Potentially inflate valuations, reducing prospective returns.\nDistortionary Effects: Tax incentives might lead investors to make decisions based on tax benefits rather than the economic viability of the start-up, potentially leading to market distortions.\nDeadweight Loss: If investments would have occurred without incentives, the tax relief represents a cost with no additional benefit (deadweight loss).\nAdministrative Costs and Complexity: The cost and complexity of administering tax incentive schemes can be significant, questioning their efficiency.\nMarket Supply vs. Demand: In some regions, the issue isn’t a lack of capital but rather a lack of demand from growth-aspiring businesses, suggesting that incentives might not always address the core issue. The article, therefore, presents a nuanced view: while there are theoretical justifications for government intervention to correct market failures in angel investing, empirical evidence on the effectiveness of such interventions, particularly through tax incentives, is mixed or suggests potential negative side effects.\n\nWhat is patient capital, and why is it not so clear cut whether AI’s can be considered patient or not?\nPatient capital refers to investments made with a long-term perspective, where investors are willing to wait for extended periods before expecting returns on their investment. Here are key characteristics:\n\nLong Investment Horizons: Investors with patient capital are not seeking immediate returns but are prepared to hold their investments over many years or even indefinitely, allowing businesses to mature and grow.\nEngagement with Investees: Beyond just financial investment, patient capital often involves active engagement with the company, providing strategic advice, mentorship, or other resources to aid in growth and development.\nExit Strategy: The focus is less on a quick exit through means like IPOs or acquisitions. Instead, the emphasis might be on sustainable growth, with exits being a natural outcome of business success rather than a primary goal from the outset.\nWhy It’s Not Clear Cut for Business Angels:\n\n\nHeterogeneity Among Angels:\n\nBusiness angels are not a homogeneous group. They vary in their investment philosophies, with some being more patient (willing to wait for long-term growth) while others might be more focused on shorter-term exits. This diversity complicates any generalization about their patience.\n\n\nInvestment Intent vs. Action:\n\nWhile some angels might initially intend to be patient, external market conditions or investment outcomes can force changes in strategy. For instance, if exit opportunities are scarce, angels might appear patient by default rather than by choice.\n\n\nExit Considerations:\n\nThe paper highlights that many business angels do not prioritize exit strategies at the investment stage. This does not necessarily mean they are patient; it might reflect a lack of clear exit planning or an assumption that good investments will naturally lead to exits.\n\n\nEngagement and Influence:\n\nAlthough angels often engage deeply with their investees, this engagement can be driven by goals of growth rather than immediate financial returns, aligning with patient capital. However, this engagement might also be strategic, aimed at improving the company’s attractiveness for a future exit.\n\n\nEmpirical Evidence:\n\nThe study shows that while a majority of angels might not be exit-oriented in their initial investment decisions, their actual patience can vary. Some angels have high expectations for exits due to need (impatient by need), while others might have a genuine long-term investment strategy (patient by intent).\n\n\nContextual and Regional Variations:\n\nThe nature of patient capital among business angels can be influenced by regional economic conditions, the availability of exit routes like IPOs or mergers, and cultural attitudes towards risk and investment duration.\n\n\nPortfolio Dynamics:\n\nAn angel’s overall portfolio might include a mix of short and long-term investments, further blurring the lines between being truly patient or not. The need to recycle capital from exits to fund new ventures can push some towards quicker exits even if they generally hold a patient view.\nGiven these factors, the classification of business angels as providers of patient capital isn’t straightforward. Their behavior on the spectrum from patience to impatience often depends on a combination of personal investment philosophy, market conditions, and the specific opportunities they encounter.\n\n\n\nWhat is a term sheet?\n\nA term sheet is a non-binding document that outlines the key terms and conditions of an investment or business deal. It serves as a template for the formal legal documents that will follow if all parties agree to the terms. Here are some common elements found in a term sheet:\n\n\nValuation - This includes the pre-money and post-money valuation of the company. Pre-money refers to the company’s value before the investment, while post-money includes the investment.\nInvestment Amount - Specifies how much money the investor intends to invest in the company.\nType of Security - Indicates whether the investment will be in the form of equity (like common or preferred stock), convertible notes, or SAFEs (Simple Agreement for Future Equity).\nDividends - Details if the investors will receive dividends, whether they are cumulative or non-cumulative, and at what rate.\nLiquidation Preference - Defines what happens upon a liquidation event (like a sale of the company). This typically outlines how much of the proceeds investors get before others.\nVoting Rights - Describes what voting rights the investors will have on corporate matters.\nAnti-Dilution Provisions - Protects investors from dilution in subsequent financing rounds, often specifying full ratchet or weighted average adjustments.\nBoard Composition - Details how the board of directors will be structured, including who gets to appoint board members.\nConversion Rights - For securities like convertible notes or preferred stock, this section explains how and when these can be converted into common stock.\nRedemption Rights - Sometimes included, these allow investors to require the company to buy back their shares after a certain period.\nDrag-Along Rights - Allows majority shareholders to force minority shareholders to join in the sale of a company.\nProtective Provisions - Lists actions that the company cannot take without the approval of certain investors or classes of stock.\nRight of First Refusal or Co-Sale - Gives existing investors the right to buy shares before they are sold to an outsider or to participate in any sale by founders or other shareholders.\nConfidentiality - Terms regarding the confidentiality of the negotiations and the term sheet itself.\nNo-Shop Clause - Often prevents the company from seeking other investors or offers for a period after signing the term sheet.\nConditions Precedent to Financing - Lists conditions that must be met before the investment is finalized. Term sheets play a critical role in negotiations, allowing both investors and founders to align on expectations before diving into more detailed legal documentation. While term sheets are typically not legally binding, certain provisions like confidentiality and exclusivity might be. The primary purpose is to streamline discussions and ensure that the major deal points are agreed upon before legal fees are incurred for drafting definitive agreements.\n"},"Maastricht/2025/q2/Entrepreneurial-Finance/Tutorial-8/Untitled":{"slug":"Maastricht/2025/q2/Entrepreneurial-Finance/Tutorial-8/Untitled","filePath":"Maastricht/2025/q2/Entrepreneurial Finance/Tutorial 8/Untitled.md","title":"Untitled","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"A comparison of the effect of angels and venture capitalists on innovation and value creation\nSummary of the Paper:\n\nThe paper titled “A comparison of the effect of angels and venture capitalists on innovation and value creation” by Supradeep Dutta and Timothy B. Folta, published in the Journal of Business Venturing in 2016, investigates how different types of private equity investors, namely angel groups and venture capitalists (VCs), influence innovation and value creation in technology ventures.\nAuthors:\nSupradeep Dutta, University at Buffalo\nTimothy B. Folta, University of Connecticut\nMain Hypothesis:\nThe authors hypothesize that: Angels and VCs contribute differently to innovation and commercialization outcomes. They suggest that while both might contribute to the rate of innovation, VCs might lead to more impactful innovations and faster commercialization due to their structured approach, governance mechanisms, and the urgency to exit investments within a certain timeframe.\nTesting the Hypotheses:\n\nData Collection: The researchers assembled a longitudinal dataset of 350 technology ventures from five technology-intensive industries, tracking investments from both angel groups and early stage VCs.\nMethodologies Employed:\n\nOLS Estimation: Used to establish baseline effects, controlling for firm and year fixed effects.\nDifference-in-Differences (DiD) Estimation: This method helped in understanding the causal effect of VC investment over time by comparing outcomes before and after investment, using angel group-backed ventures as controls.\nSwitching Regression: Applied to control for selection bias, distinguishing between the selection effect (choosing which firms to invest in) and treatment effect (actual influence post-investment).\n\n\nKey Findings:\n\nInnovation Rate: Both VCs and angels contribute equally to the rate of innovation, suggesting a substitutive role between the two in terms of patent counts.\nInnovation Impact: VC-backed ventures produce innovations with higher impact, evidenced by more citations of their patents, indicating VCs’ superior influence on the quality of innovation.\nCommercialization Speed: VC-backed firms tend to achieve successful exits (IPO or acquisition) faster than those backed by angel groups, attributed to VCs’ structured incentives for timely exits.\n\n\n\n\nValidity of Hypotheses:\n\nInnovation Hypothesis:\n\nPartially Supported: While both investors seem to drive innovation rates similarly, the impact of innovation (measured by patent citations) is significantly higher for VC-backed ventures, supporting the hypothesis that VCs contribute to more impactful innovations.\n\n\nCommercialization Hypothesis:\n\nSupported: The data clearly showed that VC-backed ventures commercialize faster, aligning with the hypothesis that VCs’ business models encourage quicker innovation cycles to exit. The study effectively used multiple methodologies to address potential biases like selection effects, providing robust insights into how different financial intermediaries affect venture outcomes. However, the authors acknowledge limitations such as not completely ruling out all selection effects and the focus on patent-based innovation metrics which might not capture all forms of innovation.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is Selection and Treatment effect?\n\nSelection Effect: This refers to the process or criteria by which investors (either venture capitalists or angel groups) choose which ventures to invest in. It involves the inherent bias where investors might select ventures based on certain observable or unobservable characteristics that could predispose those ventures to better performance or innovation, regardless of investor influence. For instance, if venture capitalists are better at picking ventures with higher inherent innovation potential due to more rigorous due diligence or industry networks, this would be a selection effect. The selection effect can lead to biased results if not accounted for, as it might appear that the investors are causing the improved innovation or performance when, in fact, they are just selecting ventures likely to succeed.\nTreatment Effect: This is the actual impact or influence that the investment from venture capitalists or angel groups has on the ventures after the investment decision has been made. It looks at how these investors might actively contribute to the development, innovation, or commercialization of the venture through their involvement, resources, networks, governance, or strategic guidance. The treatment effect isolates the value-added services provided by these investors beyond the initial selection. For example, venture capitalists might accelerate the commercialization process or enhance the quality of innovation through their networks or governance practices, which would be considered a treatment effect.\nSelection Effect: Refers to the bias introduced by investors selecting ventures likely to succeed based on inherent qualities before investment.\nTreatment Effect: The actual impact of the investor’s involvement on the venture’s innovation or performance after the investment is made.\nIn their analysis, Dutta and Folta aim to separate these effects to understand which outcomes (innovation rate, quality of innovation, speed of commercialization) are due to the choice of investment (selection effect) versus the influence post-investment (treatment effect). They employ methodologies like difference-in-differences and switching regression to account for selection bias and focus on isolating the treatment effects.\n\nAI:\ngovernance\ndirect investor\nselection\n\nSwitching regression\n\nchanges the treatment effect\n\nif for example you were VC backed then it changes the treatment to not VC backed\nThis is all that we should know\n\n\n\n\nhazard analysis is also called - survival analysis\n\nHere’s a comparison between Angel Investors (AIs) and Venture Capitalists (VCs) based on the paper by Dutta and Folta:\n\n\nAngel Investors (AIs):\n\nInvestment Stage: Typically invest in earlier stages, often in seed or startup phases, but angel groups might invest later.\nInvestment Size: Usually invest smaller amounts compared to VCs.\nGovernance Role:\n\nOften adopt a more informal or relational governance approach.\nLess stringent control rights, more entrepreneur-friendly contracts.\nMight not have the same level of board involvement or contractual control as VCs.\n\n\nInvestment Horizon:\n\nTend to have a longer-term investment horizon since they invest their own money.\nLess urgency to exit, allowing for more experimental or slower innovation processes.\n\n\nValue-Added Services:\n\nProvide industry networks, mentorship, and sometimes strategic guidance.\nTheir involvement can signal quality to other potential investors or partners.\n\n\nImpact on Innovation:\n\nContribute equally to the rate of innovation as VCs.\nMight not push for rapid commercialization due to less pressure for short-term exits.\n\n\n\n\n\nVenture Capitalists (VCs):\n\nInvestment Stage: Focus on early-stage but often enter at a slightly later stage than individual angels or after angel investments.\nInvestment Size: Typically provide larger investments, facilitating significant growth stages.\nGovernance Role:\n\nStructured governance with board representation, rigorous monitoring, and control mechanisms.\nUse of covenants and other control rights to influence venture direction.\n\n\nInvestment Horizon:\n\nHave a structured timeline due to fund lifecycle, often leading to pressure for quicker exits.\nInvestment is time-bound, usually aiming for exits within a decade.\n\n\nValue-Added Services:\n\nOffer extensive networks, strategic partnerships, professional management support.\nAct as significant endorsers, enhancing market visibility and attracting additional resources.\n\n\nImpact on Innovation:\n\nSimilar to AIs in terms of innovation rate but lead to innovations with greater impact (higher citation rates for patents).\nDrive faster commercialization, likely due to the structured pressure to achieve exits.\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Points from the Study:\n\nInnovation Rate: Both AIs and VCs contribute similarly to the rate at which patents are filed.\nInnovation Impact: VC-backed ventures see their innovations cited more often, suggesting VCs might help in creating more impactful or broadly recognized innovations.\nCommercialization: VCs are associated with quicker commercialization, possibly due to their need for a timely exit.\n\n\n\nWhat is is AI/VCs role in signlaing and building networks for startups?\n\nAI\nVC\n\n\n\nWhat role do VC/AI play in the governance and mentorship of startups?\n\n\nWhat are the three roles of VC’s according to Dutta &amp; Folta?\n\nRole as a Quality Signal and Information Intermediary\nRole in Governance:\nRole as Financial Intermediary:\n\nWhat are “serial entrepreneurs”, how are they different from “portfolio entrepreneurs”?\n\nPortfolio entrepreneurs own and manage a portfolio of businesses concurrently\nSerial founders begin and manage their ventures sequentially\n\nIn Europe, failing as an entrepreneur has quite a stigma. In the US, on the contrary, this can be seen as being part of a learning curve. How do VC’s deal with unsuccessful entrepreneurs according to these readings?\n\nNegotiation of Favorable Terms:\n\nEven previously unsuccessful serial entrepreneurs are able to negotiate better contract terms with VCs compared to novice entrepreneurs. This includes less equity dilution and greater board control. This suggests that VCs recognize the value of experience gained through past failures, which can inform and potentially enhance future entrepreneurial endeavors.\n\n\nValuation:\n\nWhile unsuccessful serial entrepreneurs do not receive higher valuations for their startups compared to novice founders, they still manage to secure better overall contract terms. This indicates that VCs are willing to provide high-powered incentives through control and cash flow rights, possibly as a recognition of the entrepreneurial effort and learning from previous ventures, even if those ventures were not successful.\n\n\nTiming of VC Investment:\n\nStartups founded by serial entrepreneurs, including those previously unsuccessful, tend to receive VC funding earlier than those founded by first-time entrepreneurs. This could be because VCs value the experience and insights gained from previous entrepreneurial attempts, even if unsuccessful, over the potential higher risk associated with failure.\n\n\nLearning from Failure:\n\nThe study highlights that entrepreneurship, even in failure, imparts valuable learning that is useful for subsequent ventures. This learning aspect is recognized by VCs, who seem to weigh the potential for improved decision-making in future ventures due to this experience.\n\n\nInvestment Decisions:\n\nVCs do not appear to solely base their investment decisions on past success or failure. Instead, they consider the entrepreneur’s ability to learn from past experiences. This is reflected in the fact that unsuccessful serial entrepreneurs are funded similarly to novice founders in terms of timing but with more favorable contract terms, suggesting a nuanced approach to risk assessment that includes entrepreneurial learning.\n\n\n\nSuccess is good but failure is not so bad either: Serial entrepreneurs and venture capital contracting\n\nSummary of the Paper: The paper titled “Success is good but failure is not so bad either: Serial entrepreneurs and venture capital contracting,” authored by Rajarishi Nahata, explores the impact of prior entrepreneurial experience on the financial contracting terms between startups and venture capitalists (VCs). The study focuses on how serial entrepreneurship influences deal terms when startups seek venture capital.\nAuthor:\n\nRajarishi Nahata from Baruch College, CUNY.\nMain Hypotheses:\n\n\nEquity Dilution:\n\nH1A and H1B: Serial entrepreneurs (both previously successful and unsuccessful) are expected to suffer less dilution of equity, meaning they negotiate better terms where VCs receive less share ownership.\n\n\nBoard Control:\n\nH2A and H2B: Serial entrepreneurs will retain greater board control over their startups compared to first-time entrepreneurs.\n\n\nFounder-CEO Duality:\n\nH3A and H3B: Serial founders are more likely to retain their CEO positions at the time of IPO.\n\n\nStartup Valuation:\n\nH4A and H4B: Serial entrepreneurs can negotiate higher valuations for their startups at VC funding, although this is primarily driven by previously successful founders.\n\n\n\n\nTesting Methodology:\n\nData Collection: The study uses a sample of VC-backed IPOs from the U.S. between 1996 and 2011, where contractual details are more accessible due to public disclosure requirements. Information on shareholdings, board representation, and founder status was hand-collected from IPO prospectuses.\nEmpirical Analysis:\n\nOLS and Logit Models: To test hypotheses, multivariate regression analyses (OLS for continuous outcomes like VC ownership and valuation, and logit for binary outcomes like founder-CEO duality) were employed. Key variables included indicators for serial entrepreneurship, VC investment details, startup characteristics, and performance metrics.\n\n\nPerformance Metrics: The study also considered startup performance metrics like profit margin, ROA, and asset turnover ratio to check if company performance rather than founder experience drove contract terms.\nFindings:\n\n\nValidity of Hypotheses:\n\nEquity Dilution and Board Control: The hypotheses were supported. Serial entrepreneurs indeed negotiated better terms, retaining more equity and board control.\nFounder-CEO Duality: Supported, with serial founders more likely to remain CEOs.\nValuation: Partially supported; previously successful serial entrepreneurs obtained higher valuations, but not the previously unsuccessful ones when compared to novice founders.\n\n\nAdditional Insights:\n\nSerial entrepreneur-backed startups were funded earlier by VCs despite not necessarily performing better than novice-founded startups. This suggests that prior entrepreneurial experience provides significant bargaining leverage in negotiations with VCs.\nThe study also found that the terms negotiated by serial entrepreneurs, even those previously unsuccessful, were generally more favorable than those by novice founders, highlighting the importance of learning from past entrepreneurial endeavors. Overall, the study validates that prior entrepreneurial experience significantly influences venture capital contracting terms, providing a nuanced view that even failure in past ventures does not entirely negate the benefits of experience in negotiating future deals.\n\n\n\nABC\n\nSummary of the Paper\n\nTitle: Blood in the Water: An Abductive Approach to Startup Valuation on ABC’s Shark Tank\n\n\nAuthors: Maude Lavanchy, Patrick Reichert, Amit Joshi (IMD Business School, Switzerland)\nMain Focus: The paper explores how startup valuation is negotiated between entrepreneurs and investors, using the unique setting of ABC’s Shark Tank, a television show where entrepreneurs pitch their ventures to a panel of investors.\nMain Hypotheses and Findings:\n\nHypothesis: Entrepreneurs who offer less initial equity are more likely to receive investment offers.\n\nTesting: The authors constructed a dataset from all episodes aired from 2009 to 2015, analyzing variables like initial equity share, venture characteristics, and negotiation outcomes. They used statistical methods like classification trees and probit models.\nResult: Confirmed. Lower initial equity offerings were associated with a higher likelihood of receiving an offer, suggesting that equity retention acts as a signal of quality.\n\n\nNegotiation Dynamics:\n\nHypothesis: Negotiations primarily involve adjustments in equity share rather than investment amount.\nTesting: Examined changes in deal terms from initial offers to final negotiations.\nResult: Supported. Negotiations tended to focus on altering the equity percentage rather than the investment amount, with investors often experiencing negotiation gains by obtaining more equity for the same investment.\n\n\nCompetitive Dynamics:\n\nHypothesis: Competition among investors leads to better deal terms for entrepreneurs.\nTesting: Analyzed scenarios where offers were made singly, jointly, or in competition.\nResult: Supported. When investors competed for a deal, entrepreneurs received terms closer to their initial ask, improving the quality of offers.\n\n\n\n\nMethodology:\n\nData Collection: Hand-collected data from Shark Tank episodes, focusing on pitch content, deal negotiations, and outcomes.\nStatistical Analysis: Utilized classification trees for initial variable selection, probit models for predicting offer likelihood, and a Heckman two-step procedure to correct for sample selection bias in negotiation analysis.\n\n\nValidity: - The hypotheses were generally validated within the context of Shark Tank, providing insights into the dynamics of startup valuation. However, the authors caution against broad extrapolation due to the unique selection criteria and entertainment focus of the show.\n\nLimitations: - The study’s setting is highly specific due to the nature of Shark Tank, where entertainment value influences pitch selection, potentially skewing the data. - The exploratory nature of the research means that while associations were established, causal relationships require further experimental validation.\n\n\nConclusion: The paper contributes to understanding the often opaque processes of startup valuation in venture capital scenarios by providing empirical evidence from a public pitch competition. It highlights the strategic importance of initial equity retention as a signal and the impact of investor competition on negotiation outcomes. However, the findings are contextual, suggesting that similar dynamics might need validation in more traditional venture capital settings.\n"},"Maastricht/2025/q2/Entrepreneurial-Finance/Untitled":{"slug":"Maastricht/2025/q2/Entrepreneurial-Finance/Untitled","filePath":"Maastricht/2025/q2/Entrepreneurial Finance/Untitled.md","title":"Untitled","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"One sentence per paragraph when writing paper or thesis just so that you know what you are talking about!"},"Maastricht/2025/thesis/06.01.2025/Feedback-Carla-08.01.2025":{"slug":"Maastricht/2025/thesis/06.01.2025/Feedback-Carla-08.01.2025","filePath":"Maastricht/2025/thesis/06.01.2025/Feedback Carla 08.01.2025.md","title":"Feedback Carla 08.01.2025","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Initial coin offerings (ICOs): Why do they succeed?\nCampino, J., Brochado, A. &amp; Rosa, Á.

Chapter 1: Introduction\nDecentralization has transformed numerous sectors for example - “complex electronics” and “multinational firms” (International Differences in Decentralization and Productivity, 2009), but the financial sector remained largely centralized (Brancaccio et al., 2018). This began to change significantly with the advent of Bitcoin in 2009, which introduced a revolutionary concept: a payment network without the need for a central authority, facilitating the transfer of value directly between users (Böhme et al., 2015; Tasca et al., 2018). This marked the inception of a sector that by December 2024 had grown to a market capitalization of over €3.25 trillion (CoinMarketCap, 2024). Within this sector, Bitcoin holds approximately 58% of the market share, with the remaining 42% distributed among a plethora of other cryptocurrencies and tokens (CoinMarketCap, 2024). The fundamental distinction between these two lies in their infrastructure; cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin operate on their own blockchain, whereas tokens leverage existing blockchains (Wu et al., 2018). The era of tokens truly began with the launch of Ethereum in 2015, which provided a platform for smart contracts, thereby fostering innovations in decentralized finance (Tikhomirov, 2018).\nNavigating the Crypto Ecosystem\nThe cryptocurrency and token ecosystem has since offered a range of solutions to various industry-specific challenges:\n\n\nBasic Attention Token (BAT) and Theta Token demonstrate how tokens can address niche problems within advertising and video distribution, respectively, by leveraging Ethereum’s infrastructure (Nakov et al., 2020).\n\n\nChainLink exemplifies the potential of tokens to extend the capabilities of blockchain by enabling smart contracts to interact with external data sources, thus broadening the application of blockchain technology (Nakov et al., 2020).\n\n\nHowever, the sector is not without its challenges:\n\n\nLiquidity and Sustainability: A significant number of coins and tokens suffer from low trading volumes, making them vulnerable to abandonment. Research indicates that 44% of publicly traded coins and only 7% of tokens face this fate, suggesting a higher resilience among tokens (Gandal et al., 2021).\n\n\nAdoption Rates: Despite the potential of cryptocurrencies, adoption remains low, with only about 20% of the population in developed countries actively using cryptocurrency platforms (Coinbase Institute, 2022).\n\n\nThis thesis aims to delve deeper into the utility classification of tokens and explore whether their “innovation focus” impacts key performance indicators such as transaction volume and price appreciation. Here, transaction volume and percentage price increase are employed as proxy metrics for project success. The underlying hypothesis is that tokens focused on specific innovations might exhibit different performance dynamics compared to those with broader or less defined applications.\nThe research question that will be answered is: “How do different innovation categories of cryptocurrencies and tokens influence their market success, as measured by transaction volume and price appreciation over time?”\nThe cryptocurrencies and token market has grown significantly and this has led to the creation of crypto projects with different utilities such as privacy utility (helping you preserve your anonymity) (De Catalunya et al., 2017), governance utility (helping you vote democratically on decisions in decentralized organizations) (Han et al., 2023) and others. However, the literature has primarily focused on technological aspects, regulation aspects, and market dynamics (Amsyar et al., 2020), (Almeida &amp; Gonçalves, 2023), (Koenraadt &amp; Leung, 2022). Even though these and other articles provide insight into the sector they lack nuance and treat the entire sector as a whole. This does not take into account the innovation category that they are part of. Furthermore, price appreciation and transaction volume have been recognized as the predominant key success metric (Dombrowski et al., 2023), (Lahmiri, 2024), but no research dives into the effect of crypto innovation category on the price and performance.\nThis thesis aims to fill a critical void in the literature by exploring how various types of innovations in cryptocurrencies and tokens influence their market performance, specifically in terms of transaction volume and price growth. By adopting a category-specific analysis combined with performance metrics, this study seeks to enhance our understanding of cryptocurrency market dynamics and deliver practical insights for investors, developers, and policymakers. The results are anticipated to not only contribute to theoretical knowledge about the relationship between token innovation and market success but also provide actionable guidance for the strategic development and assessment of cryptocurrency initiatives.\nThe thesis that will proceed by:\n\n\nClassifying Tokens by Utility: Establishing a taxonomy based on the practical applications of tokens within their ecosystems.\n\n\nAnalyzing Innovation Impact: Investigating how the focus on particular innovations influences token performance through data analysis.\n\n\nComparative Performance Analysis: Using statistical methods to compare the performance of tokens in terms of transaction volume and price changes, considering their utility classifications.\n\n\nThis approach will not only provide insights into the current state of token utility but also offer a predictive framework for assessing the potential success of new token projects based on their innovation strategy.\nBusiness Implications\nThe business significance of this study lies in its capacity to offer strategic advice to investors and entrepreneurs. By providing insights into which “innovation fields” are more prospective, this research adds another layer of analysis for “smart investors” to consider when making investment decisions. Understanding the relationship between a token’s innovation focus and its market performance can guide investment strategies, potentially leading to more informed and optimal investment choices. This research could therefore serve as a crucial tool for decision-making in the volatile and complex cryptocurrency market.\nStudies have shown that innovations in blockchain technology can significantly affect market performance. For example, the introduction of tokens designed for specific use-case like decentralized finance (DeFi) has shown to influence both transaction volumes and price dynamics so much so that the “the DeFi market should be viewed as a separate asset class from conventional cryptocurrencies” (Corbet et al., 2023). A study by Adhami, Giudici, and Martinazzi (2018) on initial coin offerings (ICOs) reveals that the perceived availability and quality of information about the project significantly influences investor interest and market success. The work of Catalini and Gans (2019) suggests that the utility aspect of tokens plays a pivotal role in investor behavior. This further strengthens the need to better understand the impact of innovation areas on investment outcomes.\nThese collectively underscore the importance of strategic innovation in token and cryptocurrency projects, providing empirical backing to the assertion that understanding the innovation field can lead to more astute investment decisions in the cryptocurrency and token sector.\nBy translating the academic findings into actionable business intelligence, this study not only aids in making more informed investment choices but also contributes to the broader understanding and development of the cryptocurrency and token ecosystem. It underscores the importance of innovation as a key driver of value in the digital economy, providing a framework for strategic investment that goes beyond traditional financial metrics.\n7. Chapter 2: Literature Review &amp; Theoretical Framework\nBusiness Innovation and its Dynamics\nBusiness innovation is a widely researched topic with significant implications for organizational success. Numerous studies define it, including Lorente et al. (1999), who describes it as “the adaptation of management systems to the changing conditions of the environment.” Innovation is vital for success as it drives improved business competitiveness and new market opportunities (Herrera, 2015).\nSector-Specific Impact on Innovation\nWhile breakthroughs in innovation occur across various entrepreneurial endeavors, they are often most impactful within small and emerging businesses. These environments foster growth and experimentation, crucial for innovation (Sahut &amp; Peris-Ortiz, 2013). However, business size is not the sole determinant of innovation success. The industry sector in which a firm operates also significantly influences the outcomes of innovation initiatives (Sherimova et al., 2022).\nThe impact of the industry sector on firm performance has been extensively studied. Short et al. (2006) found that approximately 10% of the variance in firm’s performance can be attributed to the “industry effect”, a finding corroborated by McNamara et al. (2005), who emphasized the “firm effect” as more substantial while acknowledging the importance of the “industry effect” (“firm effect” is the sole contribution of the firm’s operations to the firm’s business performance, whereas the “industry effect” is the contribution of the industry to the firm’s business performance). These studies, however, do not examine the specific characteristics of individual sectors. Furthermore, the literature review by Peng et al. (2023), states a couple of factors influencing price of cryptocurrency namely “supply and demand, technology, economics, market volatility, investors’ attributes and social media”. The review hints that the technology might have many factors influencing the price but does not go into depth of how innovation sector specifically plays a role. This research addresses that gap by focusing on the sector classification of cryptocurrencies and tokens and the impact of specific sub-sectors, particularly in the context of FinTech (Financial Technology).\nFocus on Financial Technology (FinTech) and Decentralized Finance (DeFi)\nThis research will only focus on the FinTech (Financial technology) businesses and, more specifically, the subset called DeFi (Decentralized Finance) (Zetzsche et al., 2020). FinTech, a blend of “financial” and “technology” refers to the integration of “modern Internet technologies and established business activities of the banking sector” (Iman, 2020). Whereas DeFi refers to a technology built “on distributed ledger technologies (DLT) to offer services such as trading, lending and investing without using a traditional centralised intermediary” (Auer et al., 2023). “The fact that DeFi components can be programmed may open up new possibilities for more competitive financial markets, and could bring efficiency gains” (Auer et al., 2023).\nDecentralization\nBlockchains are decentralized systems “without a centralized computer or single point of failure, these systems are resilient and capable of functioning as decentralized networks” (Rahman et al., 2024). Blockchains help to produce a single source of truth that can serve as an archive while simplifying complicated procedures especially in high regulatory environments such as banking (Treleaven et al., 2017) and in the same study it is outlined how this “technology can improve the efficiency, transparency, and cost-effectiveness of the financial sector” as a whole. The main obstacles for improving the performance of the traditional banking system are “scalability, the accessibility of user-generated web data, and the lack of global standards and infrastructure to measure the effectiveness of financial systems” (Rahman et al., 2024).\nDecentralized vs. Centralized Innovation\nAccording to classic management theory, “the visible hand of the manager” coordinates and plans for the activities of the enterprise as a whole, but new findings suggest organizations can function without a managerial figure (Hsieh &amp; Vergne, 2022). This implies that in DeFi, decentralized governance structures are far more crucial than traditional managerial roles, aligning with blockchain’s ethos of distributed trust rather than centralized control, though this model also presents unique challenges like ensuring security and managing disputes or decision-making speed. When it comes to novelty of DeFi R&amp;D, it has different characteristics than what the traditional centralized institutions produced. Eklund (2022) suggests that decentralized R&amp;D develops more inventions that are of lower average novelty compared to centralized R&amp;D which is of lower innovation quantity but of higher novelty. This paints the problem that the sheer amount of innovation [is]{.mark} huge, however, the worthwhile breakthroughs are few. As Moore (2007) states most companies often create a big number of innovation enhancements instead of focusing on a single one to bring to market which makes it such that they create innovation which does not contribute to the firm’s financial goals. This research aims to help by pinpointing what are the innovation categories that enhance the success of crypto projects.\nInnovation and Firm Performance\nInnovation lies at the core of economic expansion as “both the quantity of inventive activity, as well as its quality, are associated with economic growth” (Hasan &amp; Tucci, 2010). Moreover , innovation is also not a single form but manifests in different shapes. Doran (2012) has identified multiple types including “new to market and new to firm product innovations, process innovations and organisational innovations”. He also found that while different categories these innovations are complimentary and and do not show signs of substitutability. The promotion of innovation is done through R&amp;D activities according to Audretsch (1988), while Atalay et al. (2013) shows that technological innovation, which includes both product and process innovation, has a significant positive impact on firm performance. Furthermore, Bogetoft et al., (2024) establish that if firms that integrate not only product innovation but other innovation types, firms experience the highest performance improvements, both in the short and long term. Data from the largest public companies in the US further illustrates those higher levels of innovation correlate with enhanced performance metrics, including assets, EBITDA, market share, and “tangibility” (Kruglov &amp; Shaw, 2024). This correlation suggests that innovation is not just a driver of growth but a key determinant of a company’s competitive edge in the market. Additionally, companies that consistently innovate tend to attract better talent, secure more robust partnerships, and are better positioned to navigate regulatory changes and consumer trends, thereby securing a sustainable future.\nPerformance Metrics in Crypto Projects\nHowever, measuring performance in the DeFi and broader Web3 space differs from traditional metrics used in conventional companies. Testoni et al. (2022) outlines that price is too volatile as a performance metric for token based Web3 projects so a more appropriate measurement can be the number of transactions and the volume of these transactions. While it is true that price is too volatile on a short-term basis, when taking a large time horizon, this smoothens out the daily trading volatility. Moreira and Muir (2018) state that over the long-term volatility comes down.\nVolatility is not the only risk that impacts this asset class. Adams et al. (2024) highlight that crypto assets are not immune to the significant influence of conventional risk and monetary factors on their price movements. Radovanov et al. (2018) evaluates market success of crypto projects through the daily price appreciation while Alzahrani &amp; Daim (2019) claim that return is caused by “the increasing number of users”. Therefore, this thesis will evaluate different classified projects performance through metrics such as transaction volume, and price appreciation providing a stable and accurate assessment.\nSignaling theory\nSignals are employed in situations where there is an asymmetry of information, allowing one party to convey information to another who seeks to receive it (Connelly et al., 2010). “Signaling theory states that several markets are characterized by an information gap between buyers and sellers, notably financial markets, in which investors do not have the same level of information as entrepreneurs.” (Campino et al., 2022). When it comes to cryptocurrencies and tokens, several factors are pivotal for project success, including location proximity, social media presence, and the availability of ample documentation (Campino et al., 2022). Furthermore, signals have been identified as one of the “success factors” of a crypto project (Ackermann et al., 2019). Although innovation categories are not currently utilized to bridge significant information gaps, this is a missed opportunity that could offer investors an additional layer of clarity in making informed investment decisions, thereby enhancing the potential for success.\nResearch Gaps and Focus\nThis literature review underscores the multifaceted nature of innovation and its varied impacts across industries and organizational structures. By focusing on cryptocurrencies and tokens, this research aims to contribute to the understanding of innovation’s role in decentralized financial ecosystems, offering insights into the factors driving success in this rapidly evolving sector.\nTheoretical Framework\n\nThe independent variable, termed “innovation category,” serves as a classifier variable within the study of cryptocurrency dynamics. This variable is designed to delineate the specific innovation domain to which a crypto asset belongs, thereby aiming to elucidate the intrinsic characteristics that drive its market performance. The dependent variables under scrutiny are the price appreciation and transaction volume of the cryptocurrency. Price appreciation reflects the increase in the asset’s value over time, which can be indicative of investor confidence, market demand, and speculative activities. Transaction volume, on the other hand, quantifies the total number of trades executed within a given timeframe, serving as a proxy for market liquidity and user engagement. Morever, the high transaction volume suggest strong network effect, which Alabi (2017) proves is the case for that the crypto blockchain networks when they increase their user base.\nThese performance metrics are not merely indicators of market success but are reflective of broader adoption trends and the economic viability of blockchain technologies. The innovation category could range from payment network, like Bitcoin, which primarily functions as a digital currency, to smart contract platforms like Ethereum, which extend the utility of blockchain to programmable contracts (Buterin, 2014).\nBy analyzing how different innovation categories influence price appreciation and transaction volume, researchers can offer a more nuanced view of what drives cryptocurrency success and investors can make better business decisions.\nHypothesis Definition\nIn this subsection, the hypotheses to be investigated in the thesis are outlined, each accompanied by a rationale that supports their formulation. This approach not only clarifies the research questions but also provides a theoretical foundation for the anticipated outcomes.\n\n\nH1: Interoperability tokens will exhibit significantly higher transaction volumes compared to non-interoperability tokens over their lifetime, due to increased utility from cross-chain operations, using transaction data sourced from blockchain explorers and platforms like CoinMarketCap, CoinGecko, and DefiLlama.\n\nRationale:\n\n\n\n\nComplex blockchain applications necessitate integration across different specialized blockchains, suggesting that interoperability tokens should see higher transaction volumes. This is a common problem that researches have also pointed out, the inoperability “makes blockchains unable to communicate with each other, preventing any form of interoperability. This limitation prevents, for example, liquidity held in Bitcoin from flowing into DeFi applications” (Caldarelli, 2021). This hurts adoption and prevents complex applications. This hypothesis can be tested by analyzing transaction volume data from blockchain explorers (e.g., Etherscan for Ethereum-based tokens, BscScan for BSC tokens) and aggregating platforms like CoinMarketCap, and CoinGecko. The comparison will be made against a control group of non-interoperability tokens over the specified timeframe.\n\n\n\nH2: Stablecoins will demonstrate significantly higher transaction volumes relative to other crypto innovation categories over their lifetime, attributable to their function in providing stability and liquidity within the cryptocurrency ecosystem, as evidenced by data from blockchain explorers and analytical platforms including CoinMarketCap, CoinGecko, and DefiLlama.\n\nRationale:\n\n\n\n\nHileman (2019) shows that “[Stablecoins] are one of the largest cryptoasset categories … and also [are] a leading category across a number of other key metrics (e.g., venture funding)“. This systemic importance of in providing liquidity is further reinforced in the European Central Bank’s study (Adachi et al., 2022). Given that, it is expected that Stablecoins as an innovation category should perform better in transaction volume against many others. Moreover, stablecoin transaction volumes are often cited as surpassing even major traditional payment systems in certain contexts. Sacra’s research, as discussed in Young (2024), suggests that stablecoins could potentially exceed the transaction volumes of Visa due to their efficiency in cross-border payments and their non-stop operational capability.\n\n\n\nH3: Asset-backed cryptocurrencies are expected to exhibit lower price appreciation compared to non-asset-backed cryptocurrencies over their lifetime, as measured by price data from cryptocurrency market aggregators like CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko.\n\nRationale:\n\n\n\n\nThe majority of cryptocurrencies do not derive their value from any physical asset, as noted by Giudici et al. (2019), who state that most crypto projects are “not backed by any physical asset of value (such as gold, for example, or the equipment stock of an enterprise).” However, there’s an emerging category known as Asset-Backed Cryptocurrency, where each unit of the cryptocurrency is backed by a proportional amount of a tangible asset.\nDespite this backing, research by Jalan et al. (2021) suggests that the volatility of gold-backed cryptocurrencies remains comparable to that of Bitcoin, undermining the notion that backing by a stable asset like gold would significantly reduce risk. They further argue that these cryptocurrencies fail to exhibit the safe-haven attributes expected from their gold backing, stating, “gold-backed cryptocurrencies did not show safe-haven potential comparable to their underlying precious metal, gold.”\nThis discrepancy might be attributed to several factors. First, the perception of value in cryptocurrencies often stems from speculative demand, network effects, and technological innovations rather than the intrinsic value of backing assets. Second, the practical complexities of managing and verifying asset backing could deter investor interest or confidence.\nCollectively, these insights suggest that asset-backed cryptocurrencies might not command the price appreciation expected from their physical asset linkage, potentially lagging behind more speculative or technologically driven cryptocurrencies.\n\n\n\nH4: Meme based crypto projects are expected to exhibit lower price appreciation compared to non-meme based crypto projects over the long-term as measured by price data from cryptocurrency market aggregators like CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko.\n\nRationale:\n\n\n\n\nMeme coins are a phenomenon that has emerged in the recent years. It started as a joke of a funny image but it has grown significantly around Twitter. However, these are fairly short-sighted investor opportunities that should be evaluated very carefully (Krause, D. 2024). Krause (2024) outlines that often meme coins are a victim of “pump-and-dump\nschemes, where scammers artificially inflate a coin’s price through misleading positive statements, only to sell their holdings at the peak, causing the value to plummet”.\nCollectively, the short-term nature of memes and the social phenomena should not have a positive impact long-term capital appreciation.\n\nThese hypotheses will be rigorously tested in the Results chapter, where empirical data will either validate or challenge our theoretical assumptions, providing a comprehensive analysis of the outcomes.\n8. Chapter 3: Methods\nThe research design employed in this study is quantitative, focusing on the\nThe research question at the core of this thesis is, “How do different innovation categories of cryptocurrencies and tokens influence their market success, as measured by transaction volume and price appreciation over time?” This necessitates a quantitative approach for several compelling reasons. First and foremost, the quantitative methods allow for uncovering causality between variables, thus doing so, the thesis will be able to proof or reject the existence of a certain effect. This limits the amount of personal bias and allows for objective assessment. Furthermore, the RQ is inherently adequate for quantitate methods since the independent variable is categorical and the dependent variables are both numerical. The best analysis for such variables is using regressions analysis, time-series analysis and other statistical methods. The quantitative method allows for generalization of the findings to the broader ecosystem.\nIn the pursuit of addressing the research question, the data utilized for the quantitative analysis was sourced from the Crypto Prices, Charts, and Cryptocurrency Market Cap platform, specifically from CoinCodex (n.d.). This dataset encompasses a detailed array of metrics for each cryptocurrency project, including but not limited to:\n\nProject Name: The identifier for each cryptocurrency or token.\n\n&lt;!-- --&gt;\n\nPrice Appreciation: Quantified over various time frames, notably one year, three years, five years, and from inception to the date of data collection. This metric allows for an assessment of long-term and short-term market performance trends.\n\n&lt;!-- --&gt;\n\nAverage Daily Transaction Volume: Measured in USD, this variable captures the trading activity and liquidity of each crypto asset, aggregated over the lifetime of the project.\n\n&lt;!-- --&gt;\n\nDescription: A textual overview of each crypto project, providing qualitative insights into the purpose, technology, and unique features of the cryptocurrency or token. This metric adds a layer of contextual understanding to the quantitative data, aiding in the classification and analysis of projects according to their innovation categories.\n\nThe scope of analysis was deliberately broad, including the top 5,000 cryptocurrency projects as ranked by market capitalization. This selection criterion ensures a comprehensive examination of the most influential and significant entities within the cryptocurrency ecosystem.\nIt should be noted that the geographical origin of these crypto assets was not a factor in their inclusion; hence, the dataset represents a global perspective on cryptocurrency performance. Furthermore, to maintain the integrity and impartiality of the research, no discriminatory criteria such as age, nationality, or any other demographic characteristics were applied. The dataset included all projects that ranked within the top 5,000 on the cutoff date of November 10, 2024.\nThis approach not only underscores the inclusivity of the thesis but also underscores its commitment to providing a holistic view of the cryptocurrency market, devoid of any bias towards particular regions or demographic segments. By focusing on both quantitative market-driven metrics and qualitative descriptions, this research aims to provide insights that are broadly applicable and reflective of the dynamic nature of the crypto landscape. This dataset provided a robust foundation for categorizing crypto innovations and analyzing their market dynamics.\nCategorization of Crypto Innovation\nTo explore the patterns and drivers of innovation within the crypto ecosystem, this thesis initially attempted to employ supervised classification techniques. Supervised learning methods, where algorithms learn from training data to classify new, unlabeled data, were considered (Cunningham et al., 2008). Techniques such as Naive Bayes, Random Forests, Decision Trees, and Neural Networks were applied, leveraging libraries like ‘sklearn’, ‘numpy’, ‘torch’, and ‘transformers’ in Python (Caruana &amp; Niculescu-Mizil, 2005). These were the chosen methods because they are the industry standard when it comes to supervised classification as seen in Caruana &amp; Niculescu-Mizil (2005). A subset of the data was manually multi-labeled based on descriptive variables of each crypto asset, with descriptions encoded using tokenizers from the ‘transformers’ library to facilitate numerical processing (Jain, 2022). Multi-label binarization was also employed, acknowledging that each cryptocurrency could fit into multiple innovation categories (Adjei et al., 2020).\nDespite these efforts, the supervised methods faced significant challenges in accurately classifying the unlabeled data. Hyperparameter tuning was attempted but did not yield the desired outcomes. It is used to increase the accuracy of classification methods by plugging in them different parameters till the algorithm finds the best ones balancing accuracy and overfitting (Yu &amp; Zhu, 2020). The introduction of transformer models, notably ‘bert-base-uncased’, showed some improvement, yet the need for a larger model with more parameters was evident. However, hardware limitations restricted the use of a model with over 3 billion parameters, which ultimately led to the decision that the supervised learning approach for labeling was not viable for this study.\nConsequently, the thesis shifted to unsupervised learning, utilizing the pre-trained Large Language Model, Gemini Flash 1.5, developed by Google AI (Georgiev et al., 2024). This model was accessed through an API running on cloud infrastructure, which provided the necessary computational power without local hardware constraints. Gemini Flash 1.5, with its multimodal capabilities, processed each crypto asset’s description to independently identify innovation categories. The results from this model were then used to compile a table for statistical regression analysis, revealing clusters and trends in innovation across different projects. This approach not only circumvented the hardware limitations encountered with supervised methods but also offered a scalable solution for understanding innovation in the dynamic crypto ecosystem.\nThe result of the categorization is the list below (some of them will be explained further):\n\n\nArtificial Intelligence (AI):\n\nEncompasses all crypto projects, currencies, and tokens linked to AI technologies, applications, or enhancements.\n\n\n\nAsset Tokenization:\n\nRepresents the division of large, tangible assets like real estate into smaller, tradable digital tokens. Each token signifies ownership of a fraction of the asset.\n\n\n\nAsset-Backed Cryptocurrency:\n\nSimilar to asset tokenization, but specifically for commodities like gold or silver, providing a digital representation backed by physical assets.\n\n\n\nCommunity:\n\nTokens that focus on or are designed to foster community engagement and growth.\n\n\n\nCompute:\n\nProjects that offer decentralized computational power, enabling distributed processing tasks.\n\n\n\nCross-Chain Interoperability:\n\nTokens and projects that facilitate interactions across different blockchain networks.\n\n\n\nDecentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO):\n\nTokens with governance rights within organizations that operate autonomously through smart contracts, allowing decentralized decision-making.\n\n\n\nDecentralized Finance (DeFi):\n\nTokens involved in providing banking services like lending, borrowing, or earning interest in a decentralized manner.\n\n\n\nDecentralized Exchange (DEX):\n\nTokens associated with platforms that facilitate trading without a central authority.\n\n\n\nGaming:\n\nTokens or cryptocurrencies specifically developed for or integrated with gaming ecosystems.\n\n\n\nGovernance:\n\nTokens that grant holders voting or decision-making power within a project or protocol.\n\n\n\nIdentity:\n\nTokens that serve identity verification or authorization functions, enhancing digital identity security.\n\n\n\nIntegration with Communication Apps:\n\nTokens that integrate with or enhance messaging or communication platforms.\n\n\n\nLending:\n\nTokens used in platforms that facilitate lending and borrowing of cryptocurrency.\n\n\n\nLiquidity:\n\nTokens designed to improve or provide liquidity within decentralized markets.\n\n\n\nMeme:\n\nTokens that gain traction through viral social media content, often lacking intrinsic value but driven by community enthusiasm.\n\n\n\nMetaverse:\n\nTokens associated with virtual worlds that merge physical and digital realities, offering immersive experiences (Mystakidis, 2022).\n\n\n\nNon-Fungible Token (NFT):\n\nRepresents unique digital items on the blockchain, often tied to art, music, or collectibles (Ghelani, 2022).\n\n\n\nNFT Marketplace:\n\nTokens linked to platforms where NFTs can be bought, sold, or traded.\n\n\n\nPayment:\n\nTokens designed to facilitate transactions, focusing on ease and efficiency of payment systems.\n\n\n\nPrivacy:\n\nTokens that enhance user privacy, often through advanced cryptographic methods.\n\n\n\nProof-of-Stake (PoS):\n\nTokens in systems where the creation or validation of blocks is based on the amount of tokens held by participants.\n\n\n\nProof-of-Work (PoW):\n\nTokens in systems where block creation involves solving computational puzzles, requiring energy expenditure.\n\n\n\nSmart Contracts:\n\nTokens that interact with or are part of smart contract functionalities, automating contract execution (Kõlvart et al., 2016).\n\n\n\nSocial Media Integration:\n\nTokens that integrate with or enhance social media platforms or functionalities.\n\n\n\nStablecoin:\n\nCryptocurrencies designed to minimize volatility by pegging their value to external references like fiat currencies (What Is Stablecoin?: A Survey on Price Stabilization Mechanisms for Decentralized Payment Systems, n.d.).\n\n\n\nStorage:\n\nTokens that provide or are associated with decentralized data storage solutions.\n\n\n\nData Transformation\nAfter classification, the dataset was refined to focus on five core variables:\n\nAttribute         Type              Description\n\nClassification          Categorical             The category of innovation assigned to each cryptocurrency or token (e.g., DeFi, Community, Payments).\nVolume                  Number                  The average daily trading volume of the cryptocurrency or token over all time.\n3Y_%_Price_Change     Number                  The percentage price change over three years.\n5Y_%_Price_Change     Number                  The percentage price change over five years.\nALL_%_Price_Change    Number                  The percentage change in the cryptocurrency or token’s price over its lifespan.\nTo mitigate the impact of overly specific classifications, innovation categories that are particularly niche or unique have been excluded from the analysis. The filtering was done using threshold filter (also called frequency-based filtering), it is a standard approach that has been done by Yu &amp; Liu (2003) and many others. This approach prevents the complications associated with handling highly specialized classifications. Filtering out niche innovation categories is a recognized method to maintain focus on broader trends and avoid the complexities introduced by highly specialized data (Milojević, 2019).\nNext the price and volume data were transformed using Yeo-Johnson transformation, this helps reduce skewness and increase the data normality (Yeo et al., 2014).\nRobustness checks\nData Reliability\nTo ensure the reliability of the data, statistical analyses were performed, with a focus on internal consistency. Internal reliability was assessed using Cronbach’s alpha, a widely recognized measure in reliability testing. The calculated Cronbach’s alpha value was 0.71, which falls within the range considered ‘acceptable’ for internal consistency, as noted by Taber (2017). This indicates that the items in the scale are moderately correlated, reflecting a satisfactory level of coherence among the variables. While higher alpha values may indicate stronger consistency, the obtained result suggests the instrument is suitable for the intended analysis. Future studies could explore potential refinements to the scale to further enhance reliability.\nAssumptions\nThe initial assumption under scrutiny pertains to the normality of the variables price appreciation and transaction volume, which is pivotal for the validity of both Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) (Ståhle &amp; Wold, 1989) and Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression (Burton, 2021). Utilizing the Shapiro-Wilk test (Shapiro &amp; Wilk, 1965), we discovered that neither variable adheres to a normal distribution of its residuals. This finding suggests that applying research methods which assume normality would compromise the reliability of our results.\nSubsequently, we address another fundamental assumption: the existence of a linear relationship between the independent variables and the dependent variable. To confirm linearity, we examine the scatter plots provided below. First, we look at the plot for price appreciation:\n{width=“6.5in” height=“3.3333333333333335in”}\nThis visual analysis aids in determining whether the relationship between variables is indeed linear, a prerequisite for many statistical models we plan to use in our analysis.\nNext, we take a look at the Residual plot graph of the transaction volume variable:\n{width=“6.5in” height=“3.3333333333333335in”}Linearity between the independent and dependent variables can be inferred about the two variables from the two graphs above, which show a lack of discernible patterns and a scattering of points centered around zero on the residuals axis. Despite the presence of some outliers, an appropriate regression model will be selected to address these anomalies.\nSubsequently, a check for multicollinearity was conducted. The innovation category variable was one-hot encoded, transforming each category into a separate independent variable, thereby allowing for comparisons across all categories. A correlation matrix was then generated (Dziuban &amp; Shirkey, 1974), revealing no significant correlations among the one-hot encoded categories, thus confirming the absence of multicollinearity.\nThe next step involved testing for heteroscedasticity using White’s test (White, 1980), which is a standard method for verifying the constancy of error variance. The results of this test indicated that homoscedasticity could not be confidently ruled out, necessitating the selection of a regression model that is robust to potential heteroscedasticity.\nStatistical Analysis\nTo assess the significance of differences between innovation categories, Robust linear model with Huber regressor analysis was conducted.\nRobust regression methods are designed to appropriately weight observations that deviate from the model,” as stated by Filzmoser and Nordhausen (2020). This approach is bolstered by the application of the Huber loss function, recognized for its ability to “resist heavy-tailed errors or outliers in the response variable” (Huang &amp; Wu, 2021). This statistical technique uniquely facilitates the extraction of reliable insights from data where traditional methods might fail due to non-normality or the presence of outliers.\nThe Robust Linear Model employing Huber loss is utilized here to explore causal relationships between various innovation categories and both price appreciation and transaction volumes. This analysis allows the identification of causal links between the independent and dependent variables. This methodology allows us to discern precisely how each innovation category affects the price appreciation or transaction volume of a project, quantifying the magnitude of these effects.\nThe analysis was conducted within a Python programming environment, leveraging a suite of specialized libraries including statsmodels, pandas, and numpy for data manipulation and statistical modeling. pandas and numpy were employed to transform and adapt the raw data into a structured dataframe, which involved reshaping, and organizing the data to ensure it was in an optimal format for statistical analysis. This process facilitated efficient data handling, allowing for the seamless integration of various data types and structures into a coherent dataset. Subsequently, statsmodels was instrumental in both the validation of statistical assumptions and the execution of the robust linear model, providing tools to test for multicollinearity, heteroscedasticity, and normality of residuals, which are critical for ensuring the reliability and validity of the regression outcomes. The robust linear model was then applied to the prepared dataset, enabling the assessment of relationships between variables while accounting for potential outliers or deviations from traditional linear regression assumptions. This methodological approach not only ensured the accuracy of the data used but also the robustness of the statistical inferences drawn from the model, contributing to a comprehensive understanding of the underlying phenomena.\nJustification for Methodology\nThis methodology employs a quantitative research design, integrating statistical techniques and machine learning-based classification methods. By leveraging both unsupervised and supervised classification alongside inferential statistical tests, the study ensures a robust framework for analyzing innovation dynamics in the Web3 space.\n9. Chapter 4: Results\nIn this chapter, we present the findings derived from the methodologies outlined in the previous sections. The results are organized to reflect the research questions posed at the outset of this study, providing a comprehensive analysis of the data collected. Each section delves into specific outcomes, highlighting patterns, deviations, and significant correlations observed during the investigation. These findings not only answer our initial queries but also open avenues for further exploration and discussion in the subsequent chapters.\nDescriptive statistics\nDescriptive statistics provide an initial understanding of the data. Interestingly, the mean percentage price change is well into the negative trend, suggesting that most projects are facing a challenging future, with only a few positioned for price appreciation. Regarding transaction volume data, the statistics appear to be more evenly distributed around the mean.\n\nStatistic           Avg Daily Transaction Volume in USD   All Time Percentage Price Change\n\nCount               1414                                      1414\nMean                22.841865                                 -340.387206\nStd                 5.275091                                  497.528829\nMin                 0.000                                     -1149.365159\n25%                 19.400598                                 -764.478543\n50%                 22.614550                                 -110.726661\n75%                 26.088397                                 15.726693\nMax                 42.789946                                 4053.729504\nFurthermore, a correlation matrix was constructed to assess the relationship between all levels of the innovation category (the independent variable) and the two dependent variables, transaction volume and price appreciation. The analysis revealed no signs of multicollinearity among the variables. However, due to the extensive number of innovation category levels, the matrix is not presented here.\nPredicting Transaction Volume Based on Innovation Categories\nNext, we performed robust linear regression analyses with transaction volume as the dependent variable and innovation category as the independent variable. The results are presented in the subsequent tables. This chapter will systematically analyze each relevant table to elucidate the findings. For definitions of the innovation categories, please refer to the Methods chapter.\nThe initial table illustrates the impact when a cryptocurrency project shifts its focus from Artificial Intelligence to either Cross-Chain Interoperability or Smart Contracts. Our analysis indicates that such a transition leads to an increase in transaction volume. Interestingly enough, the AI mania that has formed in recent years (65% of organizations use generative AI in 2024 (Singla et al., 2024)) does not significantly impact many other innovation categories on a transaction volume basis.\n+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+--------------------------------------+\n| Robust Linear Model Regression Results for Volume of Transactions (USD) with Innovation Category Level: Artificial Intelligence (Python Environment Output) |                                      |\n|                                                                                                                                                                 |                                      |\n| Note: * Indicates a statistically significant coefficient                                                                                                      |                                      |\n+===============================================================================================================================================================+====================================+\n| Innovation category                                                                                                                                             | coefficient                          |\n+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+--------------------------------------+\n| Cross-Chain Interoperability                                                                                                                                    | 3.2995*                             |\n+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+--------------------------------------+\n| Smart Contracts                                                                                                                                                 | 3.6912*                             |\n+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+--------------------------------------+\nThe next table gives insight into hypothesis 1:\nH1: Interoperability tokens will exhibit significantly higher transaction volumes compared to non-interoperability tokens over their lifetime, due to increased utility from cross-chain operations, using transaction data sourced from blockchain explorers and platforms like CoinMarketCap, CoinGecko, and DefiLlama.\nThe following table illustrates the relationship between the innovation category related to cross-chain interoperability and the volume of transactions processed by tokens within these categories. When the treatment variable is set to “Cross-Chain Interoperability,” shifting to any other innovation category listed in the table leads to a decrease in transaction volume. This suggests that interoperability features do indeed causes higher transaction activity (compared to the innovation categories mentioned in the table below).\nIn terms of statistical insights, there is no statistically significant difference in transaction volume between the innovation category “Meme” and “Cross-Chain Interoperability” for example. This might imply that the appeal of meme tokens could be overshadowing the utility-driven demand for interoperability tokens in certain market segments.\nThe data partially supports Hypothesis 1. While there is a clear trend where interoperability tokens generally have higher transaction volumes, they do not universally outperform all other categories.\nFrom an investment perspective, these findings suggest that while interoperability tokens hold promise due to their utility, they are not a guaranteed outperformer across all market conditions.\n+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------+\n|

|\n+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------+\nThe table above further explores the relationship between the independent variable, innovation category, and the dependent variable, volume of transactions. Our analysis shows that when the treatment level is set to “Stablecoin,” shifting to any other innovation category listed results in a decrease in transaction volume. This observation indicates that stablecoins, due to their role in facilitating transactions with reduced volatility, tend to have higher transaction volumes compared to other categories. However, similar to the analysis for Hypothesis 1, we can conclude that Hypothesis 2 (H2) is partially supported. Hypothesis 2 posits that stablecoins will exhibit significantly higher transaction volumes compared to other types of tokens due to their utility in providing stability in volatile markets. Yet, the data does not conclusively show that stablecoins produce significantly more transaction volume against all other innovation categories. This partial support can be attributed to various factors including the market role, adoption and use cases of stablecoins, and the competitive landscape where new innovations can challenge their dominance. While stablecoins do indeed show a tendency towards higher transaction volumes, the evidence for their superiority over all other categories in this regard is not absolute, highlighting the nuanced nature of cryptocurrency markets where utility, speculation, and market dynamics interplay.\nExploring the results for other innovation category levels reveals interesting phenomena. For instance, the platform Pump.fun enables users to easily deploy new meme tokens, leading to a massive wave of meme token creation---approximately one every few seconds. However, this prolific generation does not translate into significant overperformance in terms of usage, as evidenced by the data in the table below. The Meme category only outperforms three other innovation categories. This suggests that while meme tokens enjoy a surge in creation and initial popularity, their actual utility or sustained engagement does not necessarily follow suit. Factors such as the fleeting nature of meme culture, and the lack of intrinsic value might explain why meme tokens do not dominate in transaction volume or sustained user interest across all innovation categories. This observation underscores the speculative and ephemeral nature of meme tokens within the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem, where novelty and hype can drive short-term spikes but not necessarily long-term adoption or utility.\n+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------+\n| Robust Linear Model Regression Results for Volume of Transactions (USD) with Innovation Category Level: Meme (Python Environment Output) |                                  |\n|                                                                                                                                              |                                  |\n| Note: * Indicates a statistically significant coefficient                                                                                   |                                  |\n+============================================================================================================================================+================================+\n| Innovation category                                                                                                                          | coefficient                      |\n+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------+\n| DAO                                                                                                                                          | -2.5897*                        |\n+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------+\n| Digital Currency                                                                                                                             | -5.9061**                      |\n+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------+\n| Rewards                                                                                                                                      | -3.4677***                    |\n+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------+\nThe final table of interest which examines how the innovation category predicts transaction volume, focuses on tokens associated with Smart Contracts. This table reveals that the Smart Contract category commands significantly higher transaction volumes than a considerable number of other categories. This suggests that the utility offered by smart contracts---automating, executing, and enforcing contracts on blockchain---plays a pivotal role in driving transaction activity. Smart contracts enable a wide array of applications from decentralized finance (DeFi) to non-fungible tokens (NFTs), providing not just speculation but real-world utility, which in turn fosters higher engagement and usage. This finding underscores the importance of practical application in the blockchain space, where tokens backed by smart contract functionality can lead to more sustained and substantial transaction volumes compared to categories that might be driven more by speculation or less tangible utility.\n+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------+\n|

Price Appreciation Based on Innovation Categories\nFurther, robust linear regression analyses were performed with price appreciation as the dependent variable and innovation category as the independent variable. The results are presented in the subsequent tables.\nH3: Asset-backed cryptocurrencies are expected to exhibit lower price appreciation compared to non-asset-backed cryptocurrencies over their lifetime, as measured by price data from cryptocurrency market aggregators like CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko.\nThis following table showcases how the innovation category of Asset-Backed Cryptocurrency performs in terms of price appreciation against other categories. Contrary to the hypothesis, the data reveals that most other innovation categories actually perform worse than asset-backed cryptocurrencies in terms of price growth. This finding suggests a narrative within the crypto space that contradicts the notion that significant long-term capital preservation can be achieved without real asset backing.\nThe data demonstrates that asset-backed cryptocurrencies tend to provide a more stable and perhaps even superior price appreciation path over time compared to many other categories. This might be due to the inherent value tied to tangible or financial assets, which offers a foundation of trust and stability in an otherwise volatile market. However, there are exceptions; only a few categories where asset-backed cryptocurrencies do not significantly outperform include Artificial Intelligence, Community, Meme, and Proof-of-Work.\nThe underperformance of these specific categories could be attributed to various factors: speculation, market bubbles, social media trends, cultural phenomena, established trust, and so on.\nThis analysis challenges the preconceived notions about asset-backed vs. non-asset-backed cryptocurrencies and emphasizes the role of underlying value in maintaining or increasing token prices over time. It invites further discussion on how different value propositions impact the longevity and stability of cryptocurrency investments, potentially reshaping investor strategies towards favoring asset-backed tokens for long-term growth and stability.

Contrary to what was hypothesized, the data shows that Meme tokens are outperforming most other innovation categories in terms of price growth. This unexpected finding contradicts the notion that meme-based projects would inherently have a lower price appreciation due to their perceived lack of fundamental value or utility.\nThe only categories where Meme tokens do not significantly overperform include Artificial Intelligence, Asset Tokenization, Asset-Backed Cryptocurrency, and Community. Several factors might explain why meme tokens have shown this unexpected resilience and growth: Cultural Influence, Speculative Hype.\nHowever, the categories that meme tokens do not significantly outperform hint at areas where other forms of value or innovation might still hold sway:\n\n\nAsset Tokenization and Asset-Backed Cryptocurrency: These categories benefit from being tied to real-world assets or financial instruments, providing a more grounded basis for valuation and price stability.\n\n\nCommunity: Tokens driven by strong community governance or with a dedicated user base can maintain or grow in value through collective action, development, and loyalty, which might not be as easily influenced by the ephemeral nature of meme culture.\n\n\nThe analysis suggests that while meme tokens can have surprisingly strong performance, their long-term viability might still be questioned against projects with more tangible or utility-based value propositions.

supporting the findings related to the Meme innovation category level can be found in the table below, which outlines the Community innovation category. This table paints a consistent narrative that aligns with our observations on Meme tokens. Due to their inherent nature, Meme tokens not only entertain but also foster vibrant communities around them, leading to a scenario where many meme-classified tokens exhibit behaviors typical of the Community category.\nThis convergence between meme tokens and community-driven projects is noteworthy:\n\nCommunity Building: Meme tokens often rely on community engagement for their success. They harness social media, forums, and other platforms to create a sense of belonging and shared purpose among their holders, which can significantly boost their adoption and, subsequently, their price.\n\n+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+------------------------------------+\n| Robust

Interoperability category, while outperforming in transaction volume as per Hypothesis 1, does not guarantee price appreciation supremacy (shown in the table below), highlighting a crucial insight for investors and developers. High usage does not automatically lead to high valuation; market sentiment, and broader economic factors play significant roles. Thus, for projects aiming for both high usage and long-term price impact, a strategic approach is necessary, balancing immediate utility with a vision for future growth and community building. This complexity shows that while interoperability can drive transaction volumes, achieving both functional success and market value in cryptocurrencies requires navigating a multifaceted landscape where technology, market perception, and strategic engagement are all

Chapter 5: Discussion and Conclusions\n\n\nInterpretation of results\n\n\nHow results relate to the research questions/hypotheses\n\n\nComparison with previous research\n\n\nImplications of the findings\n\n\nLimitations of the study\n\n\nThis study offers significant insights into the nuanced relationship between the classification of cryptocurrencies and tokens and their transaction volume and price appreciation. By employing a novel methodological approach, our research builds on and extends the foundational work by McGahan and Porter (1997), which examines how industry structure influences business performance.\nThe research question (RQ) of this thesis is: “How do different innovation categories of cryptocurrencies and tokens influence their market success, as measured by transaction volume and price appreciation over time?”\nThis question was addressed by analyzing the innovation category of crypto projects as a predictor of market performance.\nOur primary finding reveals that an innovation category of cryptocurrencies and tokens can achieve significant overperformance in one key metric, such as price appreciation, while lagging in another, like transaction volume. A prime example is the Meme innovation category. This indicates that innovation within a sector might lead to a product that primarily serves as a store of value rather than a medium for exchange among users. This insight, particularly highlighted in the Meme category, is supported by Krause (2024), who notes that in the long term, “a portion of meme coins backed by legitimate projects can enhance portfolio diversification and potential returns.” Our findings and Krause’s literature challenge the popular belief that social media-inspired coins do not provide long-term capital preservation. The explicit findings of this thesis detail which innovation categories underperform compared to Meme in terms of both price appreciation and transaction volume, a specific contribution to understanding how innovation categories influence market success. Moreover, by utilizing two distinct key metrics, this study allows us to differentiate market success into aspects of usage and capital preservation.\nAnother critical insight pertains to the partial support of H2, which examines the performance of the Stablecoin innovation category against others. We discovered that Stablecoins exhibit significantly higher transaction volumes compared to many other categories, though not to the extent anticipated. Lyons &amp; Viswanath-Natraj (2022) suggest the substantial potential for transaction volume within this category. However, this potential has not fully materialized, which we attribute to factors like market penetration or the inherent complexities of Stablecoins. Au et al. (2023) note that “less experienced cryptocurrency users might not understand … stablecoins” due to their complex nature, potentially explaining why this category does not outperform even more categories. Our research specifically identifies which innovation categories Stablecoins outperform in terms of transaction volume.\nAn additional insight stems from the exploration of H3, which posits that Asset-Backed Cryptocurrencies will underperform relative to other innovation categories. This hypothesis is based on the intrinsic nature of these assets, being backed by physical assets which should theoretically lead to lower volatility and higher stability, suggesting lower market returns as noted by Sehgal (2024). However, Jalan et al. (2021) present a contrasting view, stating that these assets do not exhibit safe-haven characteristics and disagreeing on implied volatility. Our results, however, contradict some of this literature; asset-backed cryptocurrencies significantly outperform numerous categories in terms of capital preservation, though they do not excel in transaction volume. This suggests that asset-backed cryptocurrencies are primarily seen as a means for storing wealth rather than functioning as a payment network.\nLimitations\nThis research underscores the intricate relationship between innovation category classifications and cryptocurrencies and tokens performance metrics. Through the combined use of ANOVA and OLS analyses, a layered understanding of how classifications can influence market dynamics has been provided. Future research should aim to explore these interactions further, potentially by incorporating additional market or regulatory variable, to offer a more comprehensive analysis of performance predictors in the cryptocurrency market.\nConclusion\n\n\nSummary of key findings\n\n\nAnswers to research questions or hypotheses\n\n\nSuggestions for future research\n\n\n12.

Students engage deeply with subjects through lectures, reading, and extensive research projects. The curriculum often covers a broad range of disciplines with an aim to expand knowledge and critical thinking in fields like sciences, arts, and humanities.\nLearning Style: The approach is generally more academic and less immediately vocational. Students are encouraged to question, explore, and contribute to their field through original research. Internships might involve more research-based activities rather than practical job training.\n\n\nApplied Science Universities:\n\nFocus: Here, the education is heavily practice-oriented, designed to equip students with specific skills needed for particular jobs. The curriculum is tailored towards direct application in professional settings, like engineering, business, or healthcare.\nLearning Style: Education involves a significant amount of practical training, including labs, workshops, and internships where students apply what they learn in real-world or simulated environments. The teaching might be more project-based or problem-based learning.\n\n\n\n\n\nHow Does the Process Work?\n\nYouTube: While not a traditional educational institution, YouTube can serve as a supplementary educational platform where:\n\nResearch Universities might share lectures, research findings, or theoretical discussions, providing insights into academic research and theoretical learning.\nApplied Science Universities could use YouTube to demonstrate practical applications, share project outcomes, or provide tutorials on specific skills or technologies used in industries.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy It Works a Certain Way:\n\nResearch Universities: The focus on theory and research stems from the historical role of universities as centers of knowledge creation and dissemination. This approach fosters innovation, deep understanding, and prepares students for further academic pursuits or roles requiring critical analysis and research skills.\nApplied Science Universities: The practical focus is driven by the need to prepare students for immediate entry into the workforce with employable skills. This method works because many industries require not just knowledge but the ability to apply that knowledge effectively in practical scenarios.\n\n\n\nDifferences and Similarities:\n\nDifferences:\n\nObjective: Research universities aim at advancing knowledge; applied science universities aim at skill application.\nTeaching Methods: More lectures and seminars in research universities versus hands-on, lab-based learning in applied science ones.\nCareer Path: Graduates from research universities might move into academia, research roles, or any field requiring deep analytical skills, whereas those from applied science universities are often directly job-ready for specific industry roles.\n\n\nSimilarities:\n\nDegree Levels: Both offer undergraduate and postgraduate degrees, though the path to getting these degrees differs in focus.\nResearch: Both types of institutions engage in research, though the nature of research in applied universities is more about application and solving immediate industry problems.\nPreparation for Further Education: Both can prepare students for further studies, although students from applied sciences might need additional preparation for purely academic research roles.\n\n\n\n\n\nTrends\n\nIncreased Focus on Entrepreneurial Universities: There’s a trend towards universities not only educating but also fostering entrepreneurial activities. Universities are creating enterprise-based promotion tracks to retain entrepreneurially inclined academics, suggesting a move towards a more business-oriented approach within academic settings. This can be seen from discussions on platforms like X where the integration of entrepreneurial activities into academic progression is highlighted.\nCollaborative Research and Development: The number of collaborative research agreements between universities and industries is on the rise, with institutions like University College Dublin leading in numbers. This indicates a growing trend where businesses look to academia not just for talent but for innovation and research capabilities, leading to mutual growth.\nSpin-out Companies: Universities are becoming hotbeds for startup ventures, with significant growth in university spin-outs. For instance, reports from the UK show how university partner funds, like Oxford Science Enterprises, significantly boost the creation of spin-out companies, suggesting an increasing trend in commercializing university research.\nSkill Development and Co-op Programs: There’s a noted value in integrating employer needs with university education through co-op programs. These programs not only provide practical experience to students but also align academic learning with industry requirements, potentially leading to better employment prospects and industry innovation.\nPublic Funding and Support: Public funding agencies, like the EPSRC in the UK, are supporting these collaborations through programs like Centres for Doctoral Training, which often involve industry partners. This indicates a policy-level push towards enhancing university-industry collaboration, aiming at societal and economic benefits.\nCultural and Communication Barriers: Despite the growth potential, there’s recognition of the cultural divide between academia and industry. Efforts to bridge this gap through better communication, simplified research for business application, and mutual respect are seen as crucial for future growth.\nDigital and Online Collaboration: The trend towards digital platforms for collaboration has been accelerated, especially in light of recent global shifts towards remote work and learning. This includes online courses co-developed by universities and businesses, offering credit towards degrees while providing industry-relevant skills.\nEconomic and Workforce Development: There’s a broader recognition of universities as key players in economic development through their collaborations with businesses. This includes not just innovation but also in preparing a workforce that’s ready for the current job market demands, as discussed in various think tanks and business forums.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResearchAppliedexamsalmost alwaysrarelyfreedom to teachalmost nonea lot of educational freedomaimdevelop sciencedevelop skillsetproject lentghvery short (all courses run for maximum 2 months and require exams)could be very long"},"startup/19.08.2024/Tasks":{"slug":"startup/19.08.2024/Tasks","filePath":"startup/19.08.2024/Tasks.md","title":"Tasks","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"3- Compare the educational process in the research universities vs Applied science\n- How does the process work?\n- YouTube\n- Why it works a certain way?\n- Can I find differences and similarities?\n- At the end of every prompt suggest me 3 follow up questions (for the AI)\n- Find Trends (relevant sources) for business and university collaboration | potential for growth\n\nHow big is the market for collaborations?\n\nNew Legislation investing in education (from Businesses)\nwww.unrealengine.com/en-US/spotlights/no-tests-allowed-how-breda-university-of-applied-sciences-is-helping-students-follow-their-game-dev-calling\n\n\nCompetitive analysis\n\nAsk AI what is the most effective way to solve the task?\n\n\n"},"startup/19.09.2024/Tasks":{"slug":"startup/19.09.2024/Tasks","filePath":"startup/19.09.2024/Tasks.md","title":"Tasks","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"\nprepare scrum\nfirst 5 minutes are\n"},"startup/29.08.2024/Solution":{"slug":"startup/29.08.2024/Solution","filePath":"startup/29.08.2024/Solution.md","title":"Solution","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssumptionStrenghtAttentionAccept it for grantedShowStopperDo you think your organization/business would benefit from a platform which connects you to international universities, giving you the opportunity to collaborate on projects?My assumption is the same, however, the question here was asked quite yo imply that a platform is a potential solution.

How is that possible? I have no idea.\n\nInitially my thoughts were that Russia has:\n\noutdoor toilets\npoor people\nlack of western products and empty shelfs in general\n\n\n\nHowever:\n\nI was nothing short of amazed.\n\nThe society seemed very capitalistic (complete opposite of the belief that they like socialism).\nIt really felt that the society had so much money. Everyone seemed to be throwing money everywhere at anything. These weren’t tourists, but actual Russian people.\nThere I have seen far more products from Western Europe than I see in Western Europe itself (of course, they are more expensive). I know that some wouldn’t believe but this is the honest truth.\nThese towns (Saint Petersburg and Moscow) are really gigantic.\n\n\n\nRussian pride\nThis is a chapter on its own\n\nI have no way to express how proud are Russians of their heritage. They have created countless number of monuments that are used to signify every important event from their history. For example:\n\nThe siege of Leningrad (Saint Petersburg)\nThe first world war\nThe fall of the Romanov family (royal family)\nCommunist monuments\nand many many others\n\n\n\nThe two sides:\n\nThe positive of taking pride in your country is that it builds good spirit. Russian citizens actually like their country.\nThe negative side is that, Russian people are not critical of their government.\n\nI think this is not the best.\n\n\n"},"vacation/2025/russia/Participants":{"slug":"vacation/2025/russia/Participants","filePath":"vacation/2025/russia/Participants.md","title":"Participants","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Таня на Миро\nЗлатина\nРумяна (лекарка на Миро)\nВанчето\nЛили родата\nВанчето\nЗлатина\n550\n100\nАвтово - кировски завод\nБаляган\nGypsy\nЗаварка (топ 3)\nSecret room\nСимач (топ 3)\nБалаган ()"},"vacation/2025/russia/theather":{"slug":"vacation/2025/russia/theather","filePath":"vacation/2025/russia/theather.md","title":"theather","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"\n\nБолшой театър (17 юли 19:00 историческа зала - Котко)\n\n\nБалкон 3 ярус, правая сторона, ред 2, място 7\n\n\nБалкон 3 ярус, правая сторона, ред 2, място 6\n\n\nБалкон 3 ярус, правая сторона, ред 2, място 8\n\n\nБалкон 3 ярус, правая сторона, ред 2, място 9\n\n\n Балкон 3 ярус, правая сторона, ред 2, място 10\n\n\n Балкон 3 ярус, правая сторона, ред 2, място 11\n\n\nБалкон 3 ярус, правая сторона, ред 2, място 12\n\n\nБалкон 3 ярус, правая сторона, ред 2, място 13\n\n\nБалкон 3 ярус, правая сторона, ред 2, място 14\n\n\nБалкон 3 ярус, правая сторона, ред 2, място 15\n\n\nБалкон 3 ярус, правая сторона, ред 2, място 16\n\n\nБалкон 3 ярус, правая сторона, ред 2, място 17\n\n\nБалкон 3 ярус, правая сторона, ред 2, място 18\n\n\nБалкон 3 ярус, правая сторона, ред 2, място 19\n\n\nБалкон 3 ярус, левая сторона, ред 2, място 35\n\n\nБалкон 3 ярус, левая сторона, ред 2, място 34\n\n\nБалкон 3 ярус, левая сторона, ред 2, място 33\n\n\nБалкон 3 ярус, левая сторона, ред 2, място 32\n\n\nБалкон 3 ярус, левая сторона, ред 2, място 31\n\n\nБалкон 3 ярус, левая сторона, ред 2, място 30\n\n\nБалкон 3 ярус, левая сторона, ред 2, място 29\n\n\n28684686 (conversation id)\n\n\n\n\nМариинский театр (13 юли 19:00 - Ромео и Джулиета)\n\n\n левая сторона, ред 2, място 63\n\n\n левая сторона, ред 2, място 62\n\n\n правая сторона, ред 2, място 23\n\n\n правая сторона, ред 2, място 20\n\n\n левая сторона, ред 3, място 43\n\n\n левая сторона, ред 3, място 42\n\n\n левая сторона, ред 3, място 41\n\n\n левая сторона, ред 3, място 40\n\n\n левая сторона, ред 3, място 39\n\n\n левая сторона, ред 3, място 38\n\n\n правая сторона, ред 3, място 10\n\n\n правая сторона, ред 3, място 9\n\n\n правая сторона, ред 3, място 8\n\n\n правая сторона, ред 3, място 7\n\n\n правая сторона, ред 3, място 6\n\n\n правая сторона, ред 3, място 5\n\n\n\n"}}
