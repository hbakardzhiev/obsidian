## For Marcel
1. How will the recent tariffs imposed by the new U.S. administration impact our manufacturing strategy?
   - Are we considering establishing a new entity in the U.S. to mitigate these effects, or is that not currently under consideration?
2. What adjustments do we anticipate for our U.S. product pricing in response to these tariffs?
   - Are we exploring a shift in our business model, such as increasing software license fees (which are tariff-exempt) to offset potential losses on hardware tariffs price increases?
   - Given that a significant portion of our profit comes from supplies like ink and media, how are we planning to address the challenges tariffs might pose to this revenue stream?
3. Looking ahead, if the new U.S. administration’s policies lead to a weaker U.S. dollar—which seems plausible—are we taking proactive steps to hedge against currency fluctuations, such as purchasing option contracts to protect our U.S. revenue?
