## For Marcel
- How will our manufacturing change due to the recent tariffs imposed by the new administration?
	- Do we have plans to open an entity there or that is not in the planning at all?
- How will our pricing of our products change in the US?
	- Will we change our business model to increase the price of the software license (which is not tarrified ) and take a loss on the price of the engine (because of the tariff)?
	- Currently, we make quite a lot of our profit on the supplies (ink and media; if i am not wrong) and that cannot be offset in a smart way, so what are we doing with that?
