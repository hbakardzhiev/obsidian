1. Take the company you analysed in the Business Model sessions; which novel technology could potentially disrupt its business model and how?
	1. Found using (AI) potential disruptors
		1. Simplified EUV Systems
			1. Japanese development by Professor Tsumoru Shintake at the Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology for a simplified EUV scanner. This could potentially make chip production cheaper if it comes to fruition, suggesting an innovation aimed at reducing the complexity and cost associated with EUV lithography
		2. Non-EUV Technologies
			1. While not directly disrupting EUV, next-generation lithography (NGL) techniques like nanoimprint lithography are gaining traction due to their simplicity and lower operational costs. These could potentially bypass some of the challenges associated with EUV if they become scalable and economically viable for high-volume manufacturing.
		3. Huawei's Breakthrough in EUV Components
			1. There have been posts about Huawei working on components for EUV lithography, like a light source component, which indicates efforts to overcome some technical barriers in EUV technology, though this is more about enhancing or localizing EUV tech rather than disrupting it
		4. China's Efforts in DUV and EUV
			1. Mention of Chinese companies like SMEE and Naura working on domestic lithography machines indicates an intent to reduce reliance on foreign technology, potentially disrupting the market dynamics if these technologies become competitive
2. How do you judge the company’s ability to adequately deal with that disruption and to uphold its position following such a technology-triggered market discontinuity
	1. AI said:
		1. That ASML could diversify its customers
		2. Could continue to invest heavily in R&D to keep the competitive edge
		3. Try to do cost management so that it has more money to spare for acquisitions
		4. try to lobby the governments for open trade with China (instead of bans)
		5. sourcing components locally to prevent scenarios hiccups in scenarios of very strong tension between China and Taiwan
		6. Intellectual property strengthening by investing even more in enforcement of patents, NDAs, cyber security and others
3. If the company you chose is a high-tech startup that introduced a new technology, you may ask yourself:
	1. From the startup’s perspective, how likely is it to displace incumbents versus to opt for an alliance approach?
		1. Actually ASML was the high-tech company that displaced the incumbents being Canon and Kodak.
	2. What can you say about possible strategies for successfully challenging incumbents?
		1. Bet on a technology that they deem impossible but ultimately if achieved gives you a new market
