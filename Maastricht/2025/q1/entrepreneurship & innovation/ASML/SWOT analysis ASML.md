What you can see here is that China accounts for 26% of the revenue of the entire company. So loosing that revenue is very problematic.

The expenses for personnel have increased significantly 
- 15% 2022 from 2021
- 40% 2023 from 2022
![](Pasted%20image%2020241008113130.png)Maybe an option would be to go for another compensation scheme that lowers the tax burden instead of directly paying out wages
