### Opportunities

##### Growing demand for advanced semiconductors
![](Pasted%20image%2020241012232224.png)
- There is a giant opportunity ASML because the growth of
	- Automotive (21% CAGR)
		- IC growth
		- processing unit
		- GPU
		- vehicle-to-everything communication
	- Industrial electronics (14% CAGR)
		- edge processors/sensors
	- High-bandwidth connectivity (10% CAGR)
		- 5G
		- 6G
	- Servers/data centers and storage (12% CAGR)
		- memory growth
		- GPU for AI
		- processor growth 
##### Expansion into emerging markets 
![](Pasted%20image%2020241012232949.png)
- Currently China is a big emerging market, but ASML could further focus on satisfying all the demand since the demand is bigger than the supply. 
- Next "rest of asia" category is very small compared to the other but Vietnam is emerging as a chip producer and has an ambition to train 50k engineers and build 6 chip producing factories till 2050. So ASML could try to establish presence.

##### Diversification of product portfolio
- Most sought after chips are the advanced ones (>10nm), however, these are not the only chips that are needed for the normal way of life. 
	- Texas instrument needs a 45nm chip https://eepower.com/news/texas-instruments-announces-new-45nm-semiconductor-manufacturing-process/
	- Raspberry pi 40nm https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/rp2040/
	- Micro-Pump Laser for Ultra-Compact Optical Amplifiers 980 nm https://en.sekorm.com/news/529432750.html
	- Wifi chips using 14nm https://www.qualcomm.com/products/technology/wi-fi/fastconnect/fastconnect-7800
- DUV machines can create the above-mentioned. ASML now is very focused on the very advanced chips but could increase its focus on the less advanced ones as well.
