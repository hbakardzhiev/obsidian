### Opportunities

##### Growing demand for advanced semiconductors
![](Pasted%20image%2020241012232224.png)
- There is a giant opportunity ASML because the growth of
	- Automotive (21% CAGR)
		- IC growth
		- processing unit
		- GPU
		- vehicle-to-everything communication
	- Industrial electronics (14% CAGR)
		- edge processors/sensors
	- High-bandwidth connectivity (10% CAGR)
		- 5G
		- 6G
	- Servers/data centers and storage (12% CAGR)
		- memory growth
		- GPU for AI
		- processor growth 
##### Expansion into emerging markets 
![](Pasted%20image%2020241012232949.png)
- Currently China is a big emerging market, but ASML could further focus on satisfying all the demand since the demand is bigger than the supply. 
- Next "rest of asia" category is very small compared to the other but Vietnam is emerging as a chip producer and has an ambition to train 50k engineers and build 6 chip producing factories till 2050. So ASML could try to establish presence.

##### Diversification of product portfolio
- Most sought after chips are the advanced ones (>10nm), however, these are not the only chips that are needed for the normal way of life. 
	- Texas instrument needs a 45nm chip https://eepower.com/news/texas-instruments-announces-new-45nm-semiconductor-manufacturing-process/
	- Raspberry pi 40nm https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/rp2040/
	- Micro-Pump Laser for Ultra-Compact Optical Amplifiers 980 nm https://en.sekorm.com/news/529432750.html
	- Wifi chips using 14nm https://www.qualcomm.com/products/technology/wi-fi/fastconnect/fastconnect-7800
- DUV machines can create the above-mentioned. ASML now is very focused on the very advanced chips but could increase its focus on the less advanced ones as well.


### Recommendation
##### Establish a Semiconductor Manufacturing Subsidiary
- USA's CHIPS act offers 280 bn dollars to companies that build manufacturing plants. doesn't produce any advanced chips on its territory 
- Strategic Location Selection
	- USA because of the subsidies
- Establish Legal and Corporate Structure
	- Legal Framework: Set up the subsidiary as per local laws which might involve registering the business, understanding local and international semiconductor regulations, and possibly engaging in joint ventures if local partnerships are beneficial or required.
	- Intellectual Property: Ensure that all ASML technology transferred to the subsidiary is properly protected under international IP laws
- Facility Setup and Technology Deployment
	- Build or Lease Manufacturing Facility: Construct a facility that meets the cleanroom standards necessary for semiconductor manufacturing. This includes Class 1 cleanrooms for the most critical processes.
	- Install Equipment: Deploy ASML's lithography machines, which could include both DUV and the latest EUV systems, depending on the subsidiary's focus.
- Talent Acquisition and Training
	- Hiring: Recruit engineers, technicians, and operational staff
	- Training Programs: Implement extensive training for employees on ASML's technology, considering ASML's unique position in EUV technology. 
- Operational Start-Up and Continuous Improvement
