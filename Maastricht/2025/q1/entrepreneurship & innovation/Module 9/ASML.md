## Geopolitics 
- governments increasingly see semiconductor manufacturing as strategically significant, chips acts are incentivizing our customers to build manufacturing facilities in the US, Europe and Asia
-  regulations require ASML to apply for Dutch export licenses for all shipments of its most advanced DUV immersion lithography systems (TWINSCAN NXT:2000i and subsequent immersion systems) as well as US licenses for mature systems for a limited number of customers in China
- From January 1, 2024, we will work with our customers to deliver the non-advanced lithography systems which are not impacted by the new restrictions
