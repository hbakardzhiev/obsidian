## Signalling 
"Signaling theory states that several markets are characterized by an information gap between buyers and sellers, notably financial markets, in which investors do not have the same level of information as entrepreneurs."
I can say that there is great information disparity between the creator of the project and the investor and entrepreneur
-> and innovation category could serve as one other option to remedy the problem 


## Success factors
"Signals are considered to be success factors of ICO projects because they reduce information asymmetries and the projects are more easily perceived as high-quality projects
(Ackermann et  al. 2020)."
