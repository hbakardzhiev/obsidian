## Signalling 
"Signaling theory states that several markets are characterized by an information gap between buyers and sellers, notably financial markets, in which investors do not have the same level of information as entrepreneurs."
I can say that there is great information disparity between the creator of the project and the investor and entrepreneur
-> and innovation category could serve as one other option to remedy the problem 

## Success factors
"Signals are considered to be success factors of ICO projects because they reduce information asymmetries and the projects are more easily perceived as high-quality projects
(Ackermann et  al. 2020)."

## Measures of success
"project’s success is directly linked to the tradability of tokens"

## Decentralization 
"Without a centralized computer or single point of failure, these systems are resilient and capable of functioning as decentralized networks."
"lockchain technology can produce safe, dependable archives of engagements and transactions while streamlining administrative processes (releaven et  al., 2017)."

## Adoption
"The third-most cited paper, chuetz and Venkatesh (2020), had 153 citations. he article investigates how blockchain technology can help ndia’s problem with financial exclusion. he study suggests that blockchain technology can improve the efficiency, transparency, and cost-effectiveness of the financial sector. n addition, the study lists other problems that need to be fixed before blockchain is applied broadly in this scenario"
