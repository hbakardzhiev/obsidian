T- General background on cryptocurrency: 
	- Mukhopadhyay, U., Skjellum, A., Hambolu, O., Oakley, J., Yu, L., & Brooks, R. (2016). A brief survey of Cryptocurrency systems. 2016 14th Annual Conference on Privacy, Security and Trust (PST). doi:10.1109/pst.2016.7906988 
		- explains basic concepts such as
			- how is the consensus organized 
			- what does a cryptocurrency mean
			- what is a blockchain and etc
- Categorization of cryptocurrency: 
	- Arsov, Aleksandar, Periodic Table of Cryptocurrencies: Blockchain Categorization (May 31, 2017). Available at SSRN: [https://ssrn.com/abstract=3095169](https://ssrn.com/abstract=3095169) or [http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3095169](https://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3095169)
		- They categorize them in 3 big categories namely:
			- Finance Focused Blockchains
			- Distributed Computing Platforms
			- Services Tokens
	- Intraday volume-return nexus in cryptocurrency markets: Novel evidence from cryptocurrency classification, Research in International Business and Finance, Volume 60, 2022, 101592, ISSN 0275-5319, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ribaf.2021.101592.
		- They classify the cryptocurrencies based of geographical location of headquarters, founder and founder’s origin, platform on which the cryptocurrency is built, and consensus algorithm, among others. Based of that they give recommendations for trading strategies. 
		- They do not classify the utility of the tokens, thus they do not focus on business success of the utility.

		- Classifies into 3 categories:
			- Technical
				- Proof-of-work vs proof-of-stake
				- Open-source vs proprietary
				- Finite vs infinite blocks
				- Block size
				- Centralized or decentralized network infrastructure
			- Economic
				- Hard peg vs soft peg vs no peg
				- Maturity level
				- Market capitalization
				- Volatility
			- Social
				- Implicit or explicit ban
				- Public sentiment
				- Public confidence in widespread adoption

		- the results suggest that CEO emotions impact underpricing in initial coin offerings
		- investors react to negative CEO emotions by demanding higher discounts on firm value

		- Suggest that price is too volatile in early startups so transactions and volume are more suitable [price is a slippery indicator](Strategic%20Management%20Journal%20-%202022%20-%20Hsieh%20-%20The%20future%20of%20the%20web%20The%20coordination%20and%20early‐stage%20growth%20of.pdf#page=16&selection=155,20,156,53)

		- classic management theory suggests that "the visible hand of the manager" "coordinates and plans for the activities of … the enterprise as a whole", **however, new findings suggest that organizations can be managed without managerial authority**

- Industry effects on performance
	- https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/smj.574
		- Suggests that 3 factors have the biggest influence on firms performance being:
			- Firm effects on performance
			- Strategic group effects on performance
			- Industry effects on performance
		- Finds evidence that the three have influence (10% of the variance firm performance is attributable to the industry effect) 
	- https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/smj.496
		- Compares the industry effect against the firm's one
			- Shows that firm's effect is more significant but does not disregard industry effect

- Decentralized R&D:
	- https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/smj.3416
		- Suggests that decentralized R&D develops more inventions that are of lower average novelty compared to centralized R&D which is lower quantity of innovation but of higher novelty
			- This is applicable to the DeFi because it suggest that there is a lot of quantity but of less quality so the sheer volume of innovation should be huge but the actual worthwhile applications would be few

		- Perhaps one of the most relevant articles that I have managed to find.
		- They try to find of things:
			- [find that the success and volatility of digital currencies depend on their business type](carmelo_cennamo_et_al_two_sides_of_the_same_coin_publishersversion.pdf#page=2&selection=28,16,29,22)
				- whether they relate to a platform business or not
				- whether they are based on their own specialized blockchain technology or on a third-party standardized platform blockchain
				- They also split the currencies into multiple categories:
					- [on the technology side, we distinguish between “coins,” digital currencies that can operate independently through their own blockchain technology, and “tokens,” digital currencies that rely on third-party blockchain infrastructures to operate](carmelo_cennamo_et_al_two_sides_of_the_same_coin_publishersversion.pdf#page=4&selection=119,0,141,26)
					- [On the business side, we distinguish between “platform-related” digital currencies, digital currencies that are related to a platform business (a platform on which users can exchange the digital currency for products or services provided by third parties or engage in peer-to-peer exchanges), and “non–platform-related” digital currencies that are not linked to any such platform business](carmelo_cennamo_et_al_two_sides_of_the_same_coin_publishersversion.pdf#page=4&selection=142,7,179,8)
				- "platform-related digital currencies grow much larger in value over time than other digital currencies"
