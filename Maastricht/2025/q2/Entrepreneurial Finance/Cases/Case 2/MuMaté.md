- ##### DuPage targets
	- its six funds had averaged a 25% pretax IRR
	- DPV’s initial commitment to a company averaged $1-5 million
		- factoring in follow-on rounds, DPV expected to invest between $3-10 million in successful companies ($50 million or more revenue within five to seven years)
- ##### Pre-money valuation
	- take the free cashflow, I got $\$9,145,000$. This is quite significant
		- there was no debt/cash mentioned. Which might distort
		- there was no amount of shares mentioned so we don't know per share
