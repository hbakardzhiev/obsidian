### How much capital should be invested by DuPage into MuMaté?

### What is the post-money valuation of MuMaté? (post-money valuation = new investment + pre-money valuation)
- ##### DuPage targets
	- its six funds had averaged a 25% pretax IRR
	- DPV’s initial commitment to a company averaged $1-5 million
		- factoring in follow-on rounds, DPV expected to invest between $3-10 million in successful companies ($50 million or more revenue within five to seven years)
- ##### Pre-money valuation
	- DCF
		- WACC
			- $$WACC=E/V*R_e+D/V*R_d*(1−T_c)$$
				- What we do not have in this formula is 
					- $E$ which is the market value of the equity
					- $D$ which is the market value of the debt
					- $V$ which is sum $E+D$ 
					- Used in $R_e$
						- beta
						- $R_p$ which is the risk premium
				- What we can somehow guess:
					- $T_c$ corporate tax rate probably around $35\%$ (according to https://x.com/i/grok/share/WGl9j3OjjibYo788tWUXfmP13)
					- $R_e$ is $$R_e=R_f+beta*(R_m-R_f)+E_p$$
						- $R_f$ is $2.42\%$ (https://x.com/i/grok/share/DaJHo6JStvm2WrcyMpC6h1Lyf)
						- $R_m$ is 10% (https://x.com/i/grok/share/DaJHo6JStvm2WrcyMpC6h1Lyf)
				- Lets calculate with some assumption lets completely ignore the debt and assume it is 0 and lets assume they only have equity. Lets assume that the beta is 0.8 (full on guess)
				- $WACC=R_e$ then $R_e=2.42\% + 0.8 * (10\%-2.42\%) + 6\% ≈ 15\%$ 
					- https://x.com/i/grok/share/IpGkl935QLtv1CSM2fwHKGtZN
				- $\sum_{year=2012}^{2015} PV(CF_{year})=-1,225,702.51$ https://x.com/i/grok/share/3W4A2EztytE8cz1bQBkcemD4j
					- $PV(2012)=-1014000/(1+15\%)$
					- $PV(2013)=-580000/(1+15\%)^2$
					- $PV(2014)=-744000/(1+15\%)^3$
					- $PV(2015)=997000/(1+15\%)^4$
				- If perpetual growth is 10%:
					- $PV(TV)= 997000*(1+10\%)/(15\%-10\%)=21,934,000$ 
				- If perpetual growth is 13%:
					- $PV(TV)= 997000*(1+13\%)/(15\%-13\%)=56,260,500$
				- $EV=55,034,797.49$
				- if we wanna get a 5.5x return on our investment
				- then the current round should be $55,034,797.49/5.5 ≈ 10,000,000$
					- and if we want $25\%$ then we should invest $2.5m \$$ 

	- take the free cashflow, I got $\$9,145,000$. This is quite significant
		- there was no debt/cash mentioned. Which might distort
		- there was no amount of shares mentioned so we don't know per share
	
### What is the appropriate size (from the perspective of your role) of the option pool? (as % of total shares outstanding after the round, including shares reserved for options; assume that the option pool will be created before DuPage invests)

### What is the appropriate board composition for MuMaté? (specifically, how many seats are to be filled by the VC, by MuMaté co-founders and by independent directors)

### Any other terms that might be negotiated?
