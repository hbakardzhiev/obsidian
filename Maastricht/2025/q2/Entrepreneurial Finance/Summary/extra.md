definition of EO
- 
what are 4 types of market risk?

- 

Business debt
- self-selection
- lender monitoring
- lender selection


in tobit we say significant or not
probit we say higher or lower 

given a table say the others are insignificant



**EO**
risk taking
innovation
proactiviness 

low EO means Pecking order theory hold
high EO don't follow Pecking order theory

the style of the mgmt is dependent on the context or the situation
the role of government certification effect -> 

H3: Pecking order applies
-> high EO, high debt, high risk


**Banks LaRocca paper**
monitoring, screening, contracting -> overcome information symmetry


**LaRocca**
adverse selection
moral hazzard - fool the investor 
firm capital structure

solving information opacity -> screening, monitoring, contracting
balance between debt and equity -> is the ultimate 

firm lifecycle -> FFS seed stage -> take the financing you get, reduce information opacity -> obtaining debt (signalling and reducing information opacity) -> retained earnings (might not be sufficient -> returning to debt) -> rebalance the capital structure once you grow

financial lifecycle
reverse lifecycle - you go for debt (using personal loan)

reverse lifecycle (limitated internal resources) -> personal debt -> as grows, you rebalance using retained earnings and equity

environmental factors -> market conditions, regulatory, cultural social norms, technological trends, government subsidies
certification hypothesis


**Valuation methods**
Top-down
BOttom-up for the DCF (what is the difference )
VC method - main limitation is default probability ,
chicago -> default probability, 
DCF
Stick to the case 


survival rate/hazzard rate
- the base is 1 and 1.02 is 2% higher

patient capital -> 

What is the underline mechanism of the Gafni paper?


Selection bias
Treatment bias?

tax shield 


**Shark tank**
 market strategy, experience, team -> signals for higher chance of offer


**Dutta**
What are the 2 types of exits?
 - Acquisition
 - IPOs

What are the 2 types of biases?
- treatment effect -> involvement of the VC means that startup increased the innovation
- selection

Venture capitalist 
- financial intermediary
- selection signal (shows that you have done sth right)
- mentorship, governance 

Angel investor:
- quality signal
- direct investor 
- governance, mentorship


hazzard / survival analysis -> VC backed businesses decrease the time to exit

VC increase the quality of innovation
VC do not increase the quantity of patents (innovation)


**Harrison 2016**
Angels are patient by default not by choice

What are the dimensions of patient capital?
- investment time horizon
- investor engagement
- exit strategy flexibility

jockey - horse
where VC bed on horse (the business)
where AI bed on jockey

difference on VS vs AI (study)

Why AI consider agency risk?
- different levels of resources
- don't use formal contracts
- difficulty to evaluate market risk
- they have experience in the industry

AI rely on personal approach

How to exit?
- sell stake (trade sell)
- acquisition


harrison 2020
- debt weight loss increases demand



carpentier
- 3 types of risk
- Entrepreneurs do not get rejected by the lack of experience but the quality of the proposal


Rijssegem
- financial knowledge -> easier to get debt
- financial knowledge means -> you are better at signalling -> reducing information asymmetry

Dai, N., Ivanov, V., & Cole, R. A. (2017)
- Enterpreneurial optimist get cheaper credit 
	- less pay trade credit late
- higher likelihood of seeking external financing

Deloof, M., La Rocca, M., & Vanacker, T. (2019)

- foreign banks could lead to worse terms for the 



**Walthoff-Borm, X., Schwienbacher, A., & Vanacker, T. (2018**
- illiquid investment
- What feedbacks they get?
	- market
	- feedback
	- testing
- support for Pecking order theory and only if firms do not have debt capacity they go for 
- lemons problem -> the entrepeneur has more information (information asymmetry)

**Vaznyte, E., & Andries, P. (2019)**
- Entrepreneurial orientation
	- low EO follow Pecking order theory
	- high EO don't follow Pecking order theory
- after breakeven then (**read again**)
- If industry is risky and high EO then debt is also 

**Cole, R.A., & Sokolyk, T. (2018)**
- only go for business bank credit -> signal high quality
- if you are not good -> personal credit

endogeneity -> no endogeneity (how did the paper handle that?)
- ask Maria if she mentioned that

logit / probit (it accounts for probability of sth; coefficients are not interpretabel)


information assymetry -> legal frameworks
debt over equity -> why? (because of information asymmetry -> moral hazzard, adverse selection)


**Walthoff-Borm, X., Schwienbacher, A., & Vanacker, T. (2018)**
Equity crowdfunding -> what were intangible assets (IP)
