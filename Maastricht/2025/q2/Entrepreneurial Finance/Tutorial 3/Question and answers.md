## Questions
- What is entrepreneurial orientation?
	- has been defined as a firm's propensity to “engage[] in product-market innovation, undertake[] somewhat risky ventures, and […] come up with ‘proactive’ innovations, beating competitors to the punch
- What link is there between giving up equity, and firm quality?
	- A high-quality start-up firm is more likely to obtain business debt than a low-quality start-up firm.
	- A high-quality start-up firm is less likely to obtain personal debt than a low-quality start-up firm.
- What is the problem with incomplete contracts?
	-  contract enforcement and property protection are not the only source of investor protection
- How can the role of asymmetric information be mitigated?
	- For example, [Kaplan and Strömberg (2001)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378426611000458#b0165) report that venture capital contracts allocate cash flow rights, voting control, and decision rights. [Bergemann and Hege’s (1998)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378426611000458#b0030) model shows that a time-varying contract (i.e., finance staging) between entrepreneurs and investors is optimal because it provides information to close the asymmetric information problem
	- entrepreneur monitoring
	- entrepreneur screenig 
	- contract enforcement
	- private equity providers are better at coping with information asymmetries surrounding new ventures, as they are more prone to employ non-traditional methods in assessing firms' future value where they consider not only financial start-ups' characteristics, but also non-financial ones (business prospect, alliances, top management team characteristics, etc.)
	- strategy–environment fit will be even more important before start-ups' break-even (when the issue of information asymmetries is the most acute)
	- business plans may serve as a primary source of information not only on objective firm characteristics, but also on a firm's level of EO
- What are the sources of finance available to nascent entrepreneurs?
	- equity
		- a start-up's ability to attract external equity capital is often regarded as a sign of quality
	- debt
		- A high-quality start-up firm is more likely to obtain business debt than a low-quality start-up firm.
		- A high-quality start-up firm is less likely to obtain personal debt than a low-quality start-up firm.
		- A firm that obtains debt at the firm's start-up exhibits superior future performance outcomes compared to a firm that obtains no debt at start-up.
- What is the difference between institutional and informal investors?
	- institutional investors rely on the experience of entrepreneurs in managing start-ups and the quality of investor protection to reduce moral hazard
	- informal investors are also common in initial start-up funding. They tend to be attracted to the type of products in the new firm. In comparison, informal investors are likely to have a social relationship with the entrepreneur, and thus have information about that person’s skill and character, which renders entrepreneurial experience less important
- What is the problem with incomplete contracts?
	- Asymmetric Information
	- Incomplete Contracts (impossible to foresee all future contingencies or because specifying all possible states of the world would be prohibitively costly or complex)
	- Moral Hazard
		- one party takes on risks because they do not bear the full consequences of their actions, or they can act in ways that are hidden from the other party
	- Agency Problems
		- The CEO's compensation package might include a significant portion of stock options and then stop R&D to decrease cost short term but the firm will suffer long-term. This all happens because of "Conflict of Interest".


### Extra information
- Investing preferences:
	- Empirical results show that investor protection has a significantly positive impact on the access to external financing regardless of the investor type. When determining information characteristics, our evidence shows that informal investors are more likely to prefer start-ups that produce new products. In sharp contrast, institutions prefer to invest in existing products. In addition, our evidence also shows that institutions are more willing to provide capital if the initial start-ups are managed by an experienced entrepreneur. Production technology is irrelevant in their financing decision. Based on the interaction between investor protection and start-up firm characteristics, we find that firm characteristics affect the likelihood of obtaining external financing significantly, while investor protection shows a marginal effect. Institutional willingness to fund new product ventures increases in a strong investor protection environment, and relies more heavily on entrepreneur experience in low legal protection environments.

self-selection - the founder already believes their business and filters himself if he is not convinced thus applies to personal loan - high-selection

high-selection - screening, monitoring, filtering (LaRocca Information assymetry)

selection by banks - creditworthiness

You get a text, I get this information, I would apply this evaluation. 
Kohl - business loans, personal loan
LaRoco - information asymetry, moral hazzard, liffecycle (the lifecycle is dependent on the industry)


Monitoring by lenders - business bank credit ,  business street credit (suppliers, interested in product, able to monitor you) 


transparency - information opacity


entrepreneurs should focus on securing business bank credit.
