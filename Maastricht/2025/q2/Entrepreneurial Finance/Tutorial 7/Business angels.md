## Angel group members' decision process and rejection criteria: A longitudinal analysis
- Business angels (BAs) play a crucial role in financing the growth of entrepreneurial ventures
- BAs finance only a tiny proportion of the proposals they receive
- Angel group members' (AGMs) attempt to control market and execution risk and favor an investment strategy focused on early exit that rejects inexperienced entrepreneurs
- Main rejection reasons:
	- competitive conditions affecting the size, growth and accessibility of the market
	- the difficulty of execution of the product or technology

##### What is the difference between angel investors, and angel investor groups?
Here are the key differences between individual business angels (BAs) and members of business angel groups (AGMs): 
1. **Decision Process:** 
	- **BAs:** Less structured, often based on personal trust and intuition. 
	- **AGMs:** More structured, with defined steps and a focus on market and execution risks. 
2. **Investment Stage:**
	- **BAs:** Tend to invest in early-stage startups. 
	- **AGMs:** Focus on later-stage firms nearing commercialization. 
3. **Exit Strategy:** 
	- **BAs:** Might not prioritize a quick exit. 
	- **AGMs:** Emphasize a clear exit strategy within a shorter time-frame. 
4. **Rejection Criteria:** 
	- **BAs:** Reject for agency issues or personal fit. 
	- **AGMs:** Primarily reject based on market and execution risks. 
5. **Experience Required:** 
	- **BAs:** Can be lenient with less experienced entrepreneurs. 
	- **AGMs:** Require substantial experience in industry, management, or prior startups. 
6. **Operational Dynamics:** 
	- **BAs:** Make decisions independently. 
	- **AGMs:** Decisions influenced by group consensus and dynamics.

Tax incentives
#### Why is government intervention justified (or not) in the AI market? What is the “market failure” to address here?
**Government Intervention in the Angel Investment Market:** 

Front-end incentive: Reduce of initial investment costs
Back-end incentive: tax deferrals on exit strategy
**Justification:** 
1. **Market Inefficiencies and Coordination Failures**: The article suggests that government intervention is justified by the need to address market inefficiencies and coordination failures in the early-stage risk capital market. This includes: 
	- **Information Asymmetry**: Where potential investors lack sufficient information about start-ups to make informed decisions. 
	- **High Uncertainty**: The inherent unpredictability in early-stage businesses makes private investment less forthcoming. 
	- **Agency Costs**: The costs associated with aligning the interests of investors with those of entrepreneurs. 
2. **Encouraging Investment in High-Growth Ventures**: Government policies aim to stimulate investment in ventures with high growth potential that might otherwise struggle to secure financing due to their risk profile. 
3. **Economic Growth and Job Creation**: By facilitating more angel investments, governments hope to promote entrepreneurship, innovation, and economic growth, which can lead to job creation. 
 **The Market Failure:** 
 - **Capital Market Failures**: The primary market failure in the context of angel investing is the suboptimal allocation of capital due to: 
	 - **Under-investment in Risky but Potentially High-Return Ventures**: Due to risk aversion, investors might not naturally flow enough capital into start-ups, leading to an under-supply of funding for innovative but risky ventures. 
	 - **Lack of Liquidity**: The market for early-stage investments can be illiquid, deterring investment. 
	 - **Externalities**: The societal benefits from new ventures (like innovation, job creation, and economic development) might not be fully captured by private returns, suggesting a role for public policy to encourage these investments. 
  **Arguments Against Intervention:** 
  1. **Ineffectiveness of Tax Incentives**: The article highlights studies indicating that tax credits might: - Not necessarily promote high-quality entrepreneurship. - Attract inexperienced investors ("dumb money"), leading to suboptimal allocation of funds. - Potentially inflate valuations, reducing prospective returns. 
  2. **Distortionary Effects**: Tax incentives might lead investors to make decisions based on tax benefits rather than the economic viability of the start-up, potentially leading to market distortions. 
  3. **Deadweight Loss**: If investments would have occurred without incentives, the tax relief represents a cost with no additional benefit (deadweight loss). 
  4. **Administrative Costs and Complexity**: The cost and complexity of administering tax incentive schemes can be significant, questioning their efficiency. 
  5. **Market Supply vs. Demand**: In some regions, the issue isn't a lack of capital but rather a lack of demand from growth-aspiring businesses, suggesting that incentives might not always address the core issue. The article, therefore, presents a nuanced view: while there are theoretical justifications for government intervention to correct market failures in angel investing, empirical evidence on the effectiveness of such interventions, particularly through tax incentives, is mixed or suggests potential negative side effects.





#### What is patient capital, and why is it not so clear cut whether AI’s can be considered patient or not?
Patient capital refers to investments made with a long-term perspective, where investors are willing to wait for extended periods before expecting returns on their investment. Here are key characteristics:
- Long Investment Horizons: Investors with patient capital are not seeking immediate returns but are prepared to hold their investments over many years or even indefinitely, allowing businesses to mature and grow.
- Engagement with Investees: Beyond just financial investment, patient capital often involves active engagement with the company, providing strategic advice, mentorship, or other resources to aid in growth and development.
- Exit Strategy: The focus is less on a quick exit through means like IPOs or acquisitions. Instead, the emphasis might be on sustainable growth, with exits being a natural outcome of business success rather than a primary goal from the outset.
Why It's Not Clear Cut for Business Angels:
1. Heterogeneity Among Angels:
    - Business angels are not a homogeneous group. They vary in their investment philosophies, with some being more patient (willing to wait for long-term growth) while others might be more focused on shorter-term exits. This diversity complicates any generalization about their patience.
2. Investment Intent vs. Action:
    - While some angels might initially intend to be patient, external market conditions or investment outcomes can force changes in strategy. For instance, if exit opportunities are scarce, angels might appear patient by default rather than by choice.
3. Exit Considerations:
    - The paper highlights that many business angels do not prioritize exit strategies at the investment stage. This does not necessarily mean they are patient; it might reflect a lack of clear exit planning or an assumption that good investments will naturally lead to exits.
4. Engagement and Influence:
    - Although angels often engage deeply with their investees, this engagement can be driven by goals of growth rather than immediate financial returns, aligning with patient capital. However, this engagement might also be strategic, aimed at improving the company's attractiveness for a future exit.
5. Empirical Evidence:
    - The study shows that while a majority of angels might not be exit-oriented in their initial investment decisions, their actual patience can vary. Some angels have high expectations for exits due to need (impatient by need), while others might have a genuine long-term investment strategy (patient by intent).
6. Contextual and Regional Variations:
    - The nature of patient capital among business angels can be influenced by regional economic conditions, the availability of exit routes like IPOs or mergers, and cultural attitudes towards risk and investment duration.
7. Portfolio Dynamics:
    - An angel's overall portfolio might include a mix of short and long-term investments, further blurring the lines between being truly patient or not. The need to recycle capital from exits to fund new ventures can push some towards quicker exits even if they generally hold a patient view.
Given these factors, the classification of business angels as providers of patient capital isn't straightforward. Their behavior on the spectrum from patience to impatience often depends on a combination of personal investment philosophy, market conditions, and the specific opportunities they encounter.





#### What is a term sheet?
- A term sheet is a non-binding document that outlines the key terms and conditions of an investment or business deal. It serves as a template for the formal legal documents that will follow if all parties agree to the terms. Here are some common elements found in a term sheet: 
1. **Valuation** - This includes the pre-money and post-money valuation of the company. Pre-money refers to the company's value before the investment, while post-money includes the investment. 
2. **Investment Amount** - Specifies how much money the investor intends to invest in the company. 
3. **Type of Security** - Indicates whether the investment will be in the form of equity (like common or preferred stock), convertible notes, or SAFEs (Simple Agreement for Future Equity). 
4. **Dividends** - Details if the investors will receive dividends, whether they are cumulative or non-cumulative, and at what rate. 
5. **Liquidation Preference** - Defines what happens upon a liquidation event (like a sale of the company). This typically outlines how much of the proceeds investors get before others. 
6. **Voting Rights** - Describes what voting rights the investors will have on corporate matters. 
7. **Anti-Dilution Provisions** - Protects investors from dilution in subsequent financing rounds, often specifying full ratchet or weighted average adjustments. 
8. **Board Composition** - Details how the board of directors will be structured, including who gets to appoint board members. 
9. **Conversion Rights** - For securities like convertible notes or preferred stock, this section explains how and when these can be converted into common stock. 
10. **Redemption Rights** - Sometimes included, these allow investors to require the company to buy back their shares after a certain period. 
11. **Drag-Along Rights** - Allows majority shareholders to force minority shareholders to join in the sale of a company. 
12. **Protective Provisions** - Lists actions that the company cannot take without the approval of certain investors or classes of stock. 
13. **Right of First Refusal or Co-Sale** - Gives existing investors the right to buy shares before they are sold to an outsider or to participate in any sale by founders or other shareholders. 
14. **Confidentiality** - Terms regarding the confidentiality of the negotiations and the term sheet itself. 
15. **No-Shop Clause** - Often prevents the company from seeking other investors or offers for a period after signing the term sheet. 
16. **Conditions Precedent to Financing** - Lists conditions that must be met before the investment is finalized. Term sheets play a critical role in negotiations, allowing both investors and founders to align on expectations before diving into more detailed legal documentation. While term sheets are typically not legally binding, certain provisions like confidentiality and exclusivity might be. The primary purpose is to streamline discussions and ensure that the major deal points are agreed upon before legal fees are incurred for drafting definitive agreements.
