### Factors explaining the emergence of new players
#### Supply-side factors
##### Economic and financial crisis related factors 
- start-ups and small firms with uncertain and risky business models have little chances to obtain bank financing for their ventures [here](New%20players%20in%20entrepreneurial%20finance%20and%20why%20they%20are%20there.pdf#page=6&selection=116,23,118,43)
- low interest rates made debt financing relatively cheap compared to other sources of entrepreneurial financing, provided that the venture’s business model is low risk and that is has enough track record and collateral
- venture capital funds, incubators or crowdfunding provided way for higher returns, This, in turn, increased the chances for innovative, high-risk ventures to receive risk capital
##### Regulation-related factors
- New exchange platforms that trade pre-IPO shares (or, in general, shares of private firms), such as SecondMarket, the main platform for trading pre-IPO shares of Facebook, or SharesPost, provide alternative venues to investors and employees for cashing out
##### Technology-related factors
- reward-based crowdfunding, peer-to-peer lending, or in-voice crowdfunding platform
##### Policy-related factors
- small firms in the US can IPO or collect funds through crowdfunding
- sub-sidized debt financing via state-owned banks and loan guarantee schemes or state subsidies for start-ups and high-growth firms

#### Demand-side factors
##### Product market-related factors
- network externalities leading "winner-take-all markets"
	- examples
		- Google
		- Facebook
	- startups need grow fast in order to establish standards and create lock-in
		- leads to **high** cash-burn rates
