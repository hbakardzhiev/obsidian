### Factors explaining the emergence of new players
#### Supply-side factors
##### Economic and financial crisis related factors 
- start-ups and small firms with uncertain and risky business models have little chances to obtain bank financing for their ventures [here](New%20players%20in%20entrepreneurial%20finance%20and%20why%20they%20are%20there.pdf#page=6&selection=116,23,118,43)
- low interest rates made debt financing relatively cheap compared to other sources of entrepreneurial financing, provided that the venture’s business model is low risk and that is has enough track record and collateral
- venture capital funds, incubators or crowdfunding provided way for higher returns, This, in turn, increased the chances for innovative, high-risk ventures to receive risk capital
##### Regulation-related factors
- New exchange platforms that trade pre-IPO shares (or, in general, shares of private firms), such as SecondMarket, the main platform for trading pre-IPO shares of Facebook, or SharesPost, provide alternative venues to investors and employees for cashing out
##### Technology-related factors
- reward-based crowdfunding, peer-to-peer lending, or in-voice crowdfunding platform
##### Policy-related factors
- small firms in the US can IPO or collect funds through crowdfunding
- sub-sidized debt financing via state-owned banks and loan guarantee schemes or state subsidies for start-ups and high-growth firms

#### Demand-side factors
##### Product market-related factors
- network externalities leading "winner-take-all markets"
	- examples
		- Google
		- Facebook
	- startups need grow fast in order to establish standards and create lock-in
		- leads to **high** cash-burn rates



#### Pecking-order theory

#### Italy use case 
##### Problems 
- Small Italian firms are financially vulnerable because of their dependency on financial institutions for external funding [here](Capital%20Structure%20Decisions%20During%20a%20Firm's%20Life%20Cycle.pdf#page=8&selection=237,22,239,42)
- "Capital markets in Italy are relatively undeveloped compared not only to those in the USA but also, to some extent, to those of other large European countries."
- "Very few companies in Italy have publicly traded corporate debt."
- "Non-bank sources of debt, other than trade credit, are few. "
- "In particular, the South of Italy is characterized by underdevelopment and inefficiency in the financial system as well as in the enforcement system. In this case, a poor institutional environment is provided, especially for small and medium-sized firms."
- "In Italy, credit availability has a strong impact on the growth potential of small firms and on the creation of new ones"

## Questions
- How does "bank debt plays a crucial role in the start-up phase of many entrepreneurial firms including high-growth ventures and venture-capital-backed start-ups" if startups do not have anything to leverage? [here](New%20directions%20in%20entrepreneurial%20finance.pdf#page=10&selection=14,35,15,90)
- If "entrepreneurial firms often seek, but rarely obtain, venture capital finance", how the heck do startups finance themselves? Is it organic growth (postive cashflow) [here](New%20directions%20in%20entrepreneurial%20finance.pdf#page=13&selection=12,0,12,77)
