### Dai, N., Ivanov, V., & Cole, R. A. (2017). Entrepreneurial optimism, credit availability, and cost of financing: Evidence from US small businesses.Journal of Corporate Finance
- Hypothesis:
	- H1A: Optimistic entrepreneurs have worse access to credit: they are more likely to pay trade credit late and less likely to have their loan applications approved, other things equal. 
	- ‚úÖ H1B: Optimistic entrepreneurs have better access to credit: they are less likely to pay trade credit late and less likely to be denied loan applications, other things equal. 
	- H2A: Optimistic entrepreneurs have higher cost of borrowing, other things equal. 
	- ‚úÖ H2B: Optimistic entrepreneurs have lower cost of borrowing, other things equal.



- optimism is measured using expectation of loan - real loan approval choice

- What is entrpreneurial 
- dispositional optimism 
- optimistic bias (sometimes referred to as overoptimism or overconfidence) results in too much entry, excessive risk taking, inferior performance and overlending
- generalized positive expectations about the future (also called dispositional optimism)
#### Optimism impact
- Existing studies show that gender, race, education, experience, and personal wealth impact the level of optimism
- males are typically more optimistic than females
- White entrepreneurs are found to be more optimistic than entrepreneurs from other races
- education increases, whilst experience decreases optimism
- optimistic entrepreneurs are less likely to pay their trade credit late


#### Access to credit
- Positive
	- more experienced entrepreneurs have better access to credit
	- optimistic entrepreneurs are less likely to pay their trade credit late
	- white entrepreneurs are more likely to get loan approval
	- Optimists often have better credit accessibility
- Negative:
	- smaller firms, firms with more short-term liability and poor growth, and those that applied for credit more often are more likely to be denied loans by financiers
	- but entrepreneurs that had been **delinquent** are less likely to get loan approval.  

#### Agency theory [link](https://x.com/i/grok/share/jUx4J2dAFP2nUEEVOdE9P2TNP)
- Principal: The owner or shareholder who delegates authority.
- Agent: The manager or executive who is hired to perform tasks on behalf of the principal.
1. ==The principal seeks to maximize their utility, which could be financial returns or other objectives, while the agent might have different goals, like personal income, job security, or prestige.==
2. **Issues:**
	1. Information Asymmetry: Agents often have more information than principals about the actions they take or the business they manage.
	2. Moral Hazard: After a contract is set, the agent might engage in behaviors that are hidden from the principal but not in the principal's best interest.
	3. Adverse Selection: Principals might not be able to select the best agents because they lack complete information about the agent's capabilities or intentions.




### Rijssegem Laurence, Paeleman Ine, H√ºnermund Egle (Vaznyte), Andries Petra.- Founder's financial knowledge and the new firm's ability to obtain debt financing 


- depth of a founder‚Äôs debt financing knowledge (i.e., how well the founder knows debt financing sources) will positively relate to the new firm‚Äôs ability to obtain the desired amount of debt
	- founders with deeper knowledge will be better at identifying/selecting relevant debt sources and at negotiating with/convincing debt providers


- Soft information
	- aids lenders decisions with completing hard data
	- builds trust
	- 
- Debt financing
	- debt financing knowledge of founders may be crucial to convince debt providers to finance a new firm in spite of this information opacity and uncertaint
	- Founders with deeper financial knowledge anticipate future financial needs of the business
	- Firms that contain little tangible assets will face higher information asymmetries and more difficulties to obtain external financing
	- Firms that use personal debt or equity financing are less likely to access debt financing

- Liability of newness
	- new firms typically lack routines, skills, information and resources ‚Äì a phenomenon known as the ‚Äúliability of newness‚Äù ‚Äì which result in higher failure rates and higher uncertainty surrounding new firms

- average marginal effect 
	- tells us the impact of the one unit increase and its impact

- Hypothesis:
	- ‚úÖ The deeper a founders knowledge the higher the debt financing
	- ‚úÖ Hypothesis 2a: The association between the depth of a founder‚Äôs debt financing knowledge and the new firm‚Äôs ability to obtain debt financing is more positive for new firms that internationalize more (conditional on the decision to raise debt financing).
		- the relationship between the depth of a founder‚Äôs debt financing knowledge and the new firm‚Äôs debt financing ability is significant and positive for all values of internationalization and this positive relationship is stronger for higher levels of internationalization. Overall, these findings support Hypothesis 2a 
	- ‚ùå Hypothesis 2b: The association between the depth of a founder‚Äôs debt financing knowledge and the new firm‚Äôs ability to obtain debt financing is more positive for new firms that innovate more (conditional on the decision to raise debt financing)
		- the relationship between the depth of a founder‚Äôs debt financing knowledge and the new firm‚Äôs debt financing ability does not depend on the new firm‚Äôs level of innovation. These findings reject Hypothesis 2b


### Marc Deloof, Maurizio La Rocca - Local banking development and the use of debt financing by new firms

- A fundamental problem in entrepreneurial finance markets‚Äîand banking markets more in particular‚Äîis informational asymmetry. Banks face informational asymmetry problems and related adverse selection and moral hazard problems when dealing with entrepreneurial firms. Adverse selection refers to the difficulties for a bank to select good credit risks ex-ante when it lacks information about the quality of the borrower
- Why entrepreneurs prefer debt if high risk?
	- It is the debt financed entrepreneur who captures all the upside in case of success, while an entrepreneur financed with equity has to share the upside with the other equity holders. As a result, it will be entrepreneurs establishing a high risk firm who will prefer debt financing

- National / Big banks
	- national banks could be more cost efficient than local banks, which are typically much smaller and less diversified. This greater cost efficiency may decrease the cost of loans, including loans to informationally opaque borrowers
	- Foreign bank entry may be ‚Äúcream skimming‚Äù whereby they lend only to the most profitable and established local firms and therefore soft information borrowers are no longer pooled 




with hard information borrowers
- Small local banks
	- Smaller local banks may be particularly suited for **relationship banking** relative to larger national banks. A bank‚Äôs borrowers contract with the bank‚Äôs loan officer, who is controlled by the bank‚Äôs senior management, which in turn operates in the interests of the bank‚Äôs shareholders. 
	- A local bank operating in the local community, whose employees belong to the local community, and which may be owned and/or managed by local community members will have a more direct and in-depth knowledge of local firms and entrepreneurs. The local bank takes part in the life of the local community, thereby acquiring information that is not available to banks that operate at a distance
	- The diversity and specialization of local markets in Italy could make it more difficult for national actors to understand these markets, thereby fostering informational asymmetry problems-again, providing an advantage to local banks.
	- local banks are better at reducing adverse selection and moral hazard problems in the financing of new firms.
	- local firms give larger loans
- National banks
	- Many loans with small amount of money
- Foreign banks
	- give loans only to the best firms and skip all the others



- Hypothesis:
	1) ‚úÖ Higher overall bank branch density at the provincial level increases the use of debt financing by new firms founded in that province.
		1) Consistent with our first hypothesis, we find that new firms are more likely to use debt and attract larger amounts of debt when they are located in a province with more bank branches
	2) üîò The positive effect of bank branch density on the use of debt financing by new firms is more pronounced for branches of local banks than for branches of national banks
		1) The positive effect of bank branches on access to debt for new firms is less pronounced for local banks than for national banks, but when local banks provide debt they provide more debt to new firms than national banks
	3) ‚úÖ The positive effect of bank branch density on the use of debt financing by new firms is less pronounced (and my even turn negative) for branches of foreign banks than for branches of domestic banks. 
		1) consistent with our third hypothesis, we further find that the presence of foreign banks in a province has a negative effect on the use of debt by local new firms


- Findings
	- Our finding that bank branch density is positively related to the use of debt raises the question how branch density affects the cost of debt.
		- more bank branches in a province not only make debt more accessible but also cheaper for new firms
	- overall branch density has a significant negative effect on the use of trade credit
		- new firms use more trade credit when access to bank debt is restricted
	- a greater branch density facilitates access to credit for new firms
		- we find that debt financing is associated with a greater or similar likelihood of survival in provinces with high branch density compared to provinces with low branch density
