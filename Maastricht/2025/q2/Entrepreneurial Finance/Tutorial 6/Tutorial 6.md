### Dai, N., Ivanov, V., & Cole, R. A. (2017). Entrepreneurial optimism, credit availability, and cost of financing: Evidence from US small businesses.Journal of Corporate Finance
- Hypothesis:
	- H1A: Optimistic entrepreneurs have worse access to credit: they are more likely to pay trade credit late and less likely to have their loan applications approved, other things equal. 
	- H1B: Optimistic entrepreneurs have better access to credit: they are less likely to pay trade credit late and less likely to be denied loan applications, other things equal. 
	- H2A: Optimistic entrepreneurs have higher cost of borrowing, other things equal. 
	- H2B: Optimistic entrepreneurs have lower cost of borrowing, other things equal.


#### Optimism impact
- Existing studies show that gender, race, education, experience, and personal wealth impact the level of optimism
- males are typically more optimistic than females
- White entrepreneurs are found to be more optimistic than entrepreneurs from other races
- education increases, whilst experience decreases optimism
- optimistic entrepreneurs are less likely to pay their trade credit late


#### Access to credit
- Positive
	- more experienced entrepreneurs have better access to credit
	- optimistic entrepreneurs are less likely to pay their trade credit late
	- white entrepreneurs are more likely to get loan approval
	- Optimists often have better credit accessibility
- Negative:
	- smaller firms, firms with more short-term liability and poor growth, and those that applied for credit more often are more likely to be denied loans by financiers
	- but entrepreneurs that had been **delinquent** are less likely to get loan approval.  

#### Agency theory [link](https://x.com/i/grok/share/jUx4J2dAFP2nUEEVOdE9P2TNP)
- Principal: The owner or shareholder who delegates authority.
- Agent: The manager or executive who is hired to perform tasks on behalf of the principal.
1. ==The principal seeks to maximize their utility, which could be financial returns or other objectives, while the agent might have different goals, like personal income, job security, or prestige.==
2. **Issues:**
	1. Information Asymmetry: Agents often have more information than principals about the actions they take or the business they manage.
	2. Moral Hazard: After a contract is set, the agent might engage in behaviors that are hidden from the principal but not in the principal's best interest.
	3. Adverse Selection: Principals might not be able to select the best agents because they lack complete information about the agent's capabilities or intentions.




### Rijssegem Laurence, Paeleman Ine, Hünermund Egle (Vaznyte), Andries Petra.- Founder's financial knowledge and the new firm's ability to obtain debt financing 


- depth of a founder’s debt financing knowledge (i.e., how well the founder knows debt financing sources) will positively relate to the new firm’s ability to obtain the desired amount of debt
	- founders with deeper knowledge will be better at identifying/selecting relevant debt sources and at negotiating with/convincing debt providers
